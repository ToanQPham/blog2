{% include about.html %}

<p>My mathematical interests are:
<ul>
  <li>the structure of derived categories
  <li>noncommutative surfaces
  <li>algebraic spaces and stacks
  <li>(derived) moduli spaces
  <li>representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras
  <li>...
</ul>

<p>Besides mathematics, I am interested in LaTeX (and typesetting in general). I also like playing classical guitar, writing counterpoint and fugues, and reading.
