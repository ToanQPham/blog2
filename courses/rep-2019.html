<h1 class="post-title">Representation theory I</h1>
<p>This page contains the information about the course <strong>V4A3 Representation Theory I</strong>, taught by <a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/ag/stroppel/">prof. dr. Catharina Stroppel</a>.
<p>In this course we will study complex semisimple Lie algebras, their classification and their representation theory.
<p>Lie algebras arise naturally as tangent spaces of Lie groups or affine algebraic groups. Their representation theory is a model for many other &mdash; often more complicated and more involved &mdash; structures in representation theory. We in particular will learn the concept of (highest) weight theory and the basic concepts of reflection groups. The first part will follow standard literature like [<a href="#">H</a>], [<a href="#K">K</a>]. The second part will be on root systems, integrality questions and Chevalley groups. If time allows we will finally deal with the famous category O of infinite dimensional highest weight modules.
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Good knowledge of basics in algebra is absolutely necessary. Some knowledge of Lie groups or affine algebraic groups will be useful for the second part.
