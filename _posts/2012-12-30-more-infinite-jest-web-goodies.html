Now there is something new: an involved art project by William Beutler based on Infinite Jest. There is:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://infiniteatlas.com/">Infinite Atlas</a> which maps all locations used in the book on Google Maps;
<li><a href="http://www.infiniteboston.com/">Infinite Boston</a> which contains a really thorough discussion of locations in Infinite Jest, including photographs!
<li><a href="http://shop.infiniteatlas.com/">Infinite Shop</a> where you can buy Infinite Jest related stuff if you feel like supporting the project.
</ul>
<p>With all this interesting stuff I feel a reread coming up.
