<p>Last week at the <a href="http://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/birep/meetings/auslander2014/workshop.php">Maurice Auslander Memorial Workshop</a><sup>*</sup> I was talking to <a href="http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~amiot/indexfr.html">Claire Amiot</a> and she told me nice news about <a href="http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernhard.keller/">Bernhard Keller</a> (who was her PhD advisor, and my MSc advisor). Last month he won the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix_Sophie-Germain">Prix Sophie Germain</a>. This news about Bernhard might not have been picked up sufficiently by the non-French speaking part of the math community (or maybe I'm just slow on picking up on these things).</p>
<p>Congratulations Bernhard!</p>
<p><small><sup>*</sup> I was considering a blogpost about the event, but as I had no internet connection at the place I was staying at that plan was doomed from the start. The talks were all really nice, and the notes made by a team of German PhD students will come online soon I have been told. If you like algebraic geometry I especially suggest looking at the notes of the talks by Becker, Buchweitz and Wemyss.</small></p>
