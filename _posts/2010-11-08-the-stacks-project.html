<p>This is a resource I cannot keep for myself. <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git/">The Stacks Project</a> is a massive collaborative effort to create a reference for algebra and algebraic geometry. Ever wanted to read a <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git/book.pdf">2236 page document on sheaves, schemes and much more</a>? Now is your chance!</p>
<p>An interesting feature is that it's possible to create <a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/">dependency graphs</a> from the project, visualizing what is necessary for a certain result. I feel frightened now.</p>
<p>And another nice resource: <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/">Math 216 (Foundations Of Algebraic Geometry) Notes</a>.</p>
