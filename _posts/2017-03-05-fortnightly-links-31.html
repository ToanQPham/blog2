<p>Thesis writing phase is almost over, we expect a return to normal blogging activities within a few weeks.

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/263202/books-on-music-theory-intended-for-mathematicians">Books on music theory intended for mathematicians</a> is a question on MathOverflow with a wealth of interesting book suggestions. On a not completely unrelated note, I am at the moment also working on my final project for my harmony and composition course. It involves fugues and the guitar, and I'll discuss it a bit on my blog soon.

  <li>Some professors' home pages contain a wealth of interesting lecture notes. It's not a secret that Brian Conrad's is one of these, but his <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/249BW16Page/index.html">lecture notes on linear algebraic groups</a> deserve a special mention. Likewise there are Paul Garrett's on <a href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~garrett/m/buildings/">buildings, BN-pairs, Hecke algebras and algebraic groups</a>.

  <li>If you like mathematics and stamps, check out <a href="http://www.mathematicalstamps.eu/index?ln=en-gb">MathStamps</a>.
