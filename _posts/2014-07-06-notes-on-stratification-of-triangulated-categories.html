<p>The last week of June I attended a <a href="http://www.lebesgue.fr/content/sem2014-categories-derivees">summer school on derived categories</a> in Nantes. Really interesting summer school, and a truly brilliant city. During the long and boring train ride home I decided to TeX up my notes for <a href="http://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~hkrause/">Henning Krause</a>'s lecture series on stratification of triangulated categories. The result of that is now proofread and corrected (thanks Henning!), and can be found on <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/notes/stratification.pdf">my personal webpage</a> (or <a href="http://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~hkrause/nantes_notes.pdf">his</a>, or hopefully the summer school's page soon).</p>
