<p>As a follow-up of <a href="{% post_url 2011-09-17-some-remarks-on-gregorian-modes %}" title="Some remarks on GregorianÂ modes">Some remarks on Gregorian modes</a>, I have written 3 counterpoint melodies to a cantus firmus that is written in a Lydian mode. The cantus is written in the bass, two of the countermelodies are in the alto tessitura and the third is written for soprano.
<p>Given the tension between "writing counterpoint in a Gregorian mode" and "counterpoint as a tonal (not modal) technique" or put more simply between "no raised leading tones" and "raising leading tones", I decided to stick to the first. This to preserve the Lydian feel as much as possible. This is afflicting the ending cadence too: no V-I movement but a VI-I movement.
<p>The cantus firmus is given in F Lydian, i.e., it roughly corresponds to F major with a natural B instead of B flat. I say roughly because we should not treat it that way, as explained before modal music dislikes the tonal idea of tension and release and a Lydian mode offers many possibilities for this approach by supplying us with notes a semitone below the tonic and the dominant. Anyway, here it is.

<p>For tessitura reasons I will transpose it to A Lydian and put the cantus in the bass. This results in the following first-species counterpoint voices.
<p>In the soprano:<br />

<p>In the alto (1):<br />

<p>The reason I'm posting this is to have some reference material when implementing other modes. I'm starting with a major mode only implementation, but to show of the awesomeness of Lilypond and save my notes from yesterday's class I wrote this. When my implementation finds one of these melodies I have absolutely reached my first goal :).
