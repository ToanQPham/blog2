<p>This fortnight's links are all about fun things you can do with derived categories of smooth projective vareties.
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10844">Mattia Ornaghi, Laura Pertusi: Voevodsky's conjecture for cubic fourfolds and Gushel-Mukai fourfolds via noncommutative K3 surfaces</a> discusses Voevodsky's conjecture relating smash-nilpotence to numerical equivalence for Chow groups to semiorthogonal decompositions of derived categories. By the work of Bernardara&ndash;Marcolli&ndash;Tabuada this geometric conjecture is equivalent to a noncommutative version (i.e. for the derived category) relating two notions of equivalence relation on the Grothendieck group.
  <p>They show Voevodsky's conjecture for cubic fourfolds and Gushel&ndash;Mukai fourfolds (who have seen considerable interest regarding rationality questions, as discussed in earlier fortnightly links) by showing that a particular blowup of these fourfolds can be described as a quadric fibration over a well-understood base. But this means that the derived category of the blowup has both a description as a blowup (containing the derived category of the original fourfold as a component) and as a quadric fibration. And for all the terms in the semiorthogonal decomposition as a quadric fibration the conjecture is known, which implies the conjecture for the blowup, hence also for the original category. Fun!


  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01902">Jeff Achter, Sebastian Casalaina-Martin, Charles Vial: Derived equivalent threefolds, algebraic representatives, and the coniveau filtration</a> gives further evidence for Orlov's conjecture, which says that derived equivalent varieties have isomorphic Chow motives (when taken with $\mathbb{Q}$-coefficients), by showing that an invariant (the intermediate Jacobian) which can be deduced from the Chow motive is actually a derived invariant, for threefolds.
