<p>One last post this year. I came across the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05WM">following statement</a> in the Stacks project:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] describing the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/021M">fppf topology</a> as being equal to the topology "generated by" Zariski coverings and by coverings of the form $latex \{f\colon T\to S\}$ where $latex f$ is <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01RZ">surjective</a> <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02KA">finite locally free</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This fact is already <a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/wordpress/?p=1297">discussed on the Stacks project blog</a>. Recall that it should be interpreted as "the categories of sheaves for this topology are the same". A similar phenomenon happens for étale and smooth.</p>
<p>For posterity I would like to collect some facts about this statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the locally noetherian case finite locally free is <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02KB">the same as finite and flat</a>;</li>
<li>the fppf topology can also be taken as the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0572">"fppfqf topology"</a>, i.e. fppf coverings can be refined by fppf coverings where each morphism is quasi-finite (again an important reduction for the proof);</li>
<li>the étale topology has a <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02LI">similar description</a>, but instead of the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05WN">four steps one takes for the fppf topology</a> one only takes 3 steps (and this is crucial in the proof);</li>
<li>it seems mysterious at first sight that Cohen-Macaulay morphisms pop up, but one first proves that <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/045U">for fppf morphisms Cohen-Macaulayness is an open condition</a> which then allows us to <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0570">slice morphisms locally of finite presentation into locally quasi-finite morphisms</a> (these two steps seem to be the hard part);</li>
</ul>
<p>With these interesting facts I will end the blogging year 2013. I hope to write more about Grothendieck topologies soon.</p>
