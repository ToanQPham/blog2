<p>Such a silly but amazing idea: <a href="http://www.lefthandedtoons.com">Left-Handed Toons</a>. I've been following them for a while now and they vary from absolutely horrendous to brilliant. Maybe brilliant in the I-want-to-kick-myself-in-the-head way, but brilliant. As I consider myself expert of the web comics (having built a web comic aggregator for a database course once, forcing me to read through feeds and feeds of comics to check everything (yeah right, I was just procrastinating)) I should spread the word about this one.
<p><a href="http://www.lefthandedtoons.com/909">Today's cartoon</a> features my favourite genre of music, go read it while you can!
<p>I promise to return to LaTeX blogging soon, but I've got exams on commutative algebra, p-adic analysis and one on function spaces coming up without proper gaps to study in between, hence no time :).
