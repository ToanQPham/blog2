  <li><p><a href="https://mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com/2018/09/11/guest-post-by-kevin-buzzard/">Guest post by Kevin Buzzard</a> is an excellent explanation of the kind of issues one runs into when trying to formalise some basic results regarding sheaf theory, as part of <a href="https://github.com/kbuzzard/lean-stacks-project">Kevin Buzzard's experiment to formalise parts of the Stacks project</a>. I occasionaly get asked questions about formalising the Stacks project, about which I can say absolutely nothing, but now I can start referring to this post.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04305">Kenta Ueyama, On Kn√∂rrer periodicity for quadric hypersurfaces in skew projective spaces</a> is a fun paper describing the singularity categories of quadric hypersurfaces <em>in skew polynomial rings</em>, where necessarily all structure coefficients are $\pm 1$. The interesting feature is that the size of the category grows (measured by number of factors equivalent to $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(k)$) the more noncommutative (measured by the size of the point scheme) one gets. It'd be interesting to figure out the general pattern, and find a good geometric description for this behavior!

  <li><p><a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/1814">OWR Report for the Arbeitsgemeinschaft: Topological cyclic homology</a> is the report for a week-long Arbeitsgemeinschaft which happened earlier this year at Oberwolfach.
