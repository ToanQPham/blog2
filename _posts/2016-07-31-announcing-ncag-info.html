<p>A while ago I decided to create a website dedicated to noncommutative algebraic geometry. It has been (silently) available for a while now, but I guess it's time to realise it to the public. You can find it at <a href="http://ncag.info">ncag.info</a>.</p>
<p>So far it is nothing more than a list of conferences that might be interesting for noncommutative algebraic geometers. I've been keeping track of these since the beginning of 2016, and I will continue to do so. If I have missed an event that would fit on this list, please tell me. If you have any other suggestions, please say so.</p>
