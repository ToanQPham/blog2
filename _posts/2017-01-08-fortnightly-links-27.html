<ul>
  <li>I completely missed <a href="http://imrn.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/11/18/imrn.rnw242.abstract">Goncalo Tabuada, Modified mixed realizations, new additive invariants, and periods of dg categories</a> when it appeared on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03411">arXiv</a>. Now it has been published, and it introduces new additive invariants for dg categories. Which is a good reason to read it.

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00830">Rizzardo&ndash;Van den Bergh, A note on non-unique enhancements</a> constructs a $k$-linear triangulated category with two incomparable ($\mathrm{A}_\infty$)-enhancements, where <em>$k$ is a field</em>. I think there might have been some hope that at least over a field such a thing was impossible, but the Alice&ndash;Michel combo is good at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4039">shattering hopes</a> regarding the triangulated vs. dg setting.

  <li><a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/gjasso/resources/pdf/notes/dg-notes.pdf">Gustavo Jasso, Differential graded categories</a> is a set of lecture notes on dg categories. They look amazing, both mathematically and visually. I don't know whether the course is already over or not, according to the <a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/gjasso/teaching/ws16/v5a5/">course's website</a> the exam isn't until the end of February, so I can only hope that part&nbsp;III will be extended.
</ul>

<p>I guess this fortnight's theme was dg categories.
