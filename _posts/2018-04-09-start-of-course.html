<p>If you happen to be in the Bonn area, and you want to learn a thing or two about Hochschild (co)homology, let me remind you that <a href="/teaching/hh-2018">my course</a> is starting tomorrow.

<p>If you don't happen to be in the Bonn area, or there is some reason why you cannot be in the lectures, there will be lecture notes. The first part of these should be online in a few days' time.
