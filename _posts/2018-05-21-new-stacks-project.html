<p>Almost 6 years ago, I wrote a blogpost <a href="{% post_url 2012-07-19-a-new-website-for-the-stacks-project %}">A new website for the Stacks project</a> announcing the first version of the Stacks project website. Today v2 has been released, see <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu"><var>stacks.math.columbia.edu</var></a>.

<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://chngr.github.io">Raymond Cheng</a> and <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/">Johan de Jong</a> for the hard work we've done together, and <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/">Peter Woit</a> for helping us with the server administration.

<p>The main point of the new website as a user is that it is <em>mobile-friendly</em>. It should look good on tablets and smartphones, and if it doesn't, please tell us.

<p>Less important for your average user, but very important to us, is that the system (called Gerby), is much more flexible. See the <a href="https://gerby-project.github.io">website for Gerby</a> for more information.
