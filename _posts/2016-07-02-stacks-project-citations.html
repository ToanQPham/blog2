<p>I was wondering how often the Stacks project gets cited nowadays. I wanted to check this both on arXiv and MathSciNet, but the fulltext search of arXiv only returns its results in a way not suitable for easy processing (and also not all of the results it seems, because the oldest preprint is from 2014), so I had to stick to MathSciNet.

<p>So what I did is look at how often "stacks project" appears in the references on MathSciNet, and after some parsing (and with the sample being taken today) this gives the following results, broken down by year:

<table>
<style scoped>
  td {
    text-align: right;
  }
</style>

<tr>
  <th>year</th>
  <th>#citations</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2010</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2011</td>
  <td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2012</td>
  <td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2013</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2014</td>
  <td>14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2015</td>
  <td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2016</td>
  <td>14</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In total, the Stacks project has been cited 77 times so far.
