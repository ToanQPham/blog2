<p>It has been a while since I actively used TeX and encountered interesting issues, but as the work on my Master thesis has finally started I am again TeX'ing. It feels great!
<p>The <code><a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/todonotes">todonotes</a></code> package is a great tool if you're as disorganized as I am, whenever I have a random idea, or don't feel like finishing something or don't want to add the correct citation, etc. I add a <code>\todo{}</code> and postpone the work. Postponing is good.
<p>And if you can postpone work in a fancy way it's even better! So I've got 5 "categories" of notes, each with its own color and options. An example (click for pdf):<br />
<a href="http://pbelmans.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/todo.pdf"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/todo-example.png" alt="" /></a><br />
The interesting part is that I'm using the <code><a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/xparse">xparse</a></code> package, to have <em>optional commands</em>. So I can choose between <code>\addreference</code> and <code>\addreference{to that particular book for which I don't feel like creating a BibTeX entry right now}</code>. It's really easy, just put

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage{xparse}

\DeclareDocumentCommand\addreference{g}{\todo[color = blue!30]{Add reference\IfNoValueF{#1}{: #1}}}
\DeclareDocumentCommand\checkthis{g}{\todo[color = red!50]{Check this\IfNoValueF{#1}{: #1}}}
\DeclareDocumentCommand\fixthis{g}{\todo[color = orange!50]{Fix this\IfNoValueF{#1}{: #1}}}
\DeclareDocumentCommand\expand{g}{\todo[color = green!50]{Expand\IfNoValueF{#1}{: #1}}}
\newcommand\removethis{\todo[color = yellow!50]{Remove this?}}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>in your preamble when you have <code>todonotes</code> loaded. Adding the option <code>textsize = small</code> to your <code>\usepackage</code> command might be a good idea, and there is <code>colorinlistoftodos</code> if you want colored boxes in the list.
