<p>This post is one big triviality. But I only realised now why homotopy colimits in triangulated categories are defined <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/090Z">the way they are defined</a>.
<p>Just think of triangulated categories as a bit wonky abelian categories, and in (non-wonky) abelian categories a colimit can be constructed from having coproducts and coequalisers. In a triangulated category you don't have coequalisers / cokernels, but <em>cones</em> play this role. Hence one takes a particular cone of a direct sum that simulates a coequaliser, and one is done.
<p>Of course, everything dualises to <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08TC">homotopy limits</a>.
<p>Why did no-one tell me this?!
<p><small>Each statement is to be interpreted under suitable conditions on the objects in sight, e.g. existence of direct sums etc. etc.</small>
