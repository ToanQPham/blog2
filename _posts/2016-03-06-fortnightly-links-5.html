<p>This fortnight it's just 3 interesting preprints on the arXiv. But boy are they fun reads!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05992">Geometry and categorification</a> by Ben Webster. In case you've been wondering (just like I was) what people in representation theory are exactly doing with flag varieties, or just want to get a general overview of categorification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07491v1">Morphisms to Brauer-Severi varieties, with applications to del Pezzo surfaces</a> by Christian Liedtke. It is based on the funny observation that one could try to replace projective spaces in the yoga of ample line bundle by their twisted forms (the Brauer-Severi varieties), and try to gain arithmetic data from this. Fun!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00785v1">Moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces</a> by Justin Sawon. Before this article I couldn't say I understood much about stability conditions in the context of moduli spaces of sheaves. After reading it I'm not saying that I do, but I am at least getting used to it as von Neumann would say.</p>
</li>
</ul>
