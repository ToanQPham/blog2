  <li><p>Ever wondering what a good notation for some finite group is? Or how to give a succinct description of it? Or just see a wealth of other group-theoretic information for finite groups of order at most 500? One can use <a href="http://groupnames.org">groupnames.org</a> for this.
  <p><small>I couldn't find information about how the system is set up unfortunately. It'd be interesting to learn more about that.</small>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02876">Daniel Huybrechts: Hodge theory of cubic fourfolds, their Fano varieties, and associated K3 categories</a> discusses the Hodge and lattice-theoretic properties of cubic fourfolds. In all honesty, this is an aspect that I know very little about, but these notes definitely make the literature less daunting.
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12858">Adeel Khan: Descent by quasi-smooth blow-ups in algebraic K-theory</a> proves Orlov's blowup formula in the very general setting of perfect complexes on a derived Artin stack with quasi-smooth centre. I'm wondering whether the statement now is sharp, or whether there are even more general cases in which a blowup formula must hold. Also a new criterion for cdh descent is given, and this is used to give a clean proof that homotopy invariant K-theory satisfies it.
