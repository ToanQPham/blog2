<p>Apparently this fact isn't mentioned anywhere on the Internet. At least not in a straight-forward manner, I had to discover it by inspecting the corresponding articles on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The code to produce a <em>direct limit</em> and an <em>inverse limit</em> is <code>\varinjlim</code> respectively <code>\varprojlim</code>. This is the result:</p>
<p>$\varinjlim, \varprojlim$</p>
<p>Let this fact be known.</p>
