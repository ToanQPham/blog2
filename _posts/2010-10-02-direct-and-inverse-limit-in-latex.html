<p>Apparently this fact isn't mentioned anywhere on the Internet. At least not in a straight-forward manner, I had to discover it by inspecting the corresponding articles on Wikipedia.
<p>The code to produce a <em>direct limit</em> and an <em>inverse limit</em> is <code>\varinjlim</code> respectively <code>\varprojlim</code>. This is the result:
$$\varinjlim, \varprojlim$$
<p>Let this fact be known.
