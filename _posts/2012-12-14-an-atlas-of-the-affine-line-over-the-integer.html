<p>It has been a while since I blogged. I've been busy (bad excuse), and I've been not-finishing posts lately (or actually having an idea and then not even starting it). But in a few days there will be an interesting announcement which explains some of my past activities, so stay tuned, even if you don't like this blog post (or <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/atlas/">its corresponding page</a>).
<p>My fascination for $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{Z}[x]$ has already led to a blogpost in which <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/a-latex-version-of-mumfords-impression-of-spec-zx-or-some-tikz-tricks/">I recreated Mumford's famous map in PGF/TikZ</a>. This morning I came across <strong>another</strong> map of  $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{Z}[x]$ by David Mumford, in his Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface, and I decided to create an overview of <strong>all</strong> maps of this interesting object. And a collection of maps is called an atlas, so the result can be found at the page <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/atlas/">Atlas of $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{Z}[x]$</a> (at some point I need to create a better location for this, abusing pages on my blog doesn't feel right).
<p>Later I will add comments to the maps, explaining why they are particularly interesting and how they relate to the other maps, but for now this will do.
<p>If you have any remarks, corrections, or if you know of any other maps of $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{Z}[x]$ in the literature, please contact me!
