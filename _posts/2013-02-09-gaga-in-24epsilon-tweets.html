<p>In 1956 Jean-Pierre Serre published an important paper in <em>Annales de l'institut Fourier</em> called <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=AIF_1956__6__1_0"><em>Géométrie algébrique et géométrie analytique</em></a>, or GAGA. Using results from this other seminal paper <a href="http://www.mat.uniroma1.it/people/arbarello/FAC.pdf"><em>Faisceaux algébriques cohérents</em></a> (English: Coherent algebraic sheaves) or FAC, from 1955, he shows there is a really strong (and unexpected?) link between the analytic and algebraic world.
<p>Ever since I learnt about this paper I wanted to do something with it, to pay tribute somehow. And in the meantime I could solidify my knowledge about it, because there are of course important assumptions and strong results underlying GAGA. I also wanted to know what <em>does not</em> hold, as of course the analytic and algebraic world aren't equivalent. I'm not sure whether the approach of summarizing GAGA in $24+\epsilon$ tweets (corresponding to the 24 paragraphs) in the paper is any good, so this is an experiment. A similar idea can be found in the MathOverflow thread <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/43889/proof-synopsis-collection">Proof synopsis collection</a>.
<p>The $+\epsilon$ is to accomodate the fact that certain paragraphs are just definitions and don't contain necessarily mentionable ideas, and some paragraphs contain several. Being the good analyst I am by daily training (ahem) I can even quantify $\epsilon$ as <strong>8</strong>. Remark that I count LaTeX symbols as 1 character, not by their macro length, as I could do everything in Unicode (but I don't like the results this gives). So the next section is both a table of contents of GAGA (which is non-existent in the real paper) and a listing of things I find especially interesting or important.
<p>Recall before we start that a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on a ringed space $X$ (either analytic or algebraic of nature) is a $\mathcal{O}_X$-module of finite type (i.e. there exists an open neighbourhood for each point such that the restriction of the sheaf is generated by a finite number of sections) and for every morphism $\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U\to\mathcal{F}|_U$ the kernel is of finite type). In the noetherian algebraic case this reduces to the adagium "looks locally like a finitely generated module", but in the analytic situation this notion is something more subtle (as far as I can tell). And of course the general ringed space situation is subtle, that's why my definition was wrong at first.

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The three big results from complex analysis we use are Oka's coherence theorem (tweet 2) and Cartan A and B (tweet 23). I've been interested in their proof, but I never actually tried to read them thoroughly (they look scary at first and second sight). I might do this at some point, and if I can write something reasonable about it I will.
<p>In tweet 18 I mention the idea of a <em>décalage</em> argument. Just like <em>dévissage</em> this is a French term which nicely describes a recurring technique in algebraic geometry. Maybe I should at some point write a blog post about these, it is my impression that the only way of learning the existence of these terms is by reading French texts on algebraic geometry which is something not everyone does. And once you have a word for something it becomes easier to remember.
<p>So the main conditions we have used are that things are compact and projective.
<h2>Slogan</h2>
<p>As this post is mostly about slogans anyway, here's one for GAGA.
<blockquote><p>
  If $X$ is a <em>projective</em> algebraic variety then we have for $\mathcal{F}$ a <em>coherent</em> (algebraic) sheaf that the cohomology in the algebraic case is isomorphic to the cohomology of the associated analytic sheaf on the associated analytic variety. The categories of coherent sheaves on $X$ and $X^\mathrm{h}$ are equivalent.
