  <li><a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~aperry/NCHPD.pdf">Alexander Perry, Noncommutative homological projective duality</a> is a preprint which is not (yet) on the arXiv, discussing homological projective duality in a very general setting. Therefore it also deals with noncommutative varieties in the sense that they are only supposed to be sufficiently nice (enhancements of) triangulated categories. Therefore it contains a long discussion of the formalism, which in itself is a very interesting read.

  <li><a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~aperry/HH.pdf">Alexander Perry, Hochschild cohomology and group actions</a> is another preprint on Alex's website which is not yet on the arXiv. It compares Hochschild cohomology of an equivariant triangulated category with the invariant part of Hochschild cohomology of a triangulated category, in order to compute the Hochschild cohomology of some fractionally Calabi&ndash;Yau categories. It's a very nice read.

  <li><a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/huybrech/Cubics">Daniel Huybrechts, Cubic hypersurfaces</a> are the course notes for a course currently being taught at the University of Bonn. They are in a state of flux, with regular updates. Both the lectures themselves and the notes are really good.
