<p>As part of the <a href="http://latex-community.org/component/content/article/92-contests/431-gnuplot-book">LaTeX and Graphics contest</a> currently active at <a href="http://latex-community.org">LaTeX-Community</a> I have written an article about my view on the current state of TeX and graphics. Maybe I will eventually crosspost it to my weblog in one form or another, but for the moment you can read it there: <a href="http://latex-community.org/component/content/article/50-latex-graphics-figures-tables/436-graphics-tools">Why should I be using TeX for graphics?</a> Check out the others too, an overview is given at the bottom of the <a href="http://latex-community.org/component/content/article/92-contests/431-gnuplot-book">overview post</a>.
