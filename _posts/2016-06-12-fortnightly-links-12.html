<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00332v1">Dmitry Orlov, Gluing of categories and Krull--Schmidt partners</a> is a very short paper (just 4 pages) that discusses a neat construction of what Orlov calls Krull--Schmidt partners: given a semi-orthogonal decomposition produce a (different) fully faithful functor, giving rise to a possibly new semi-orthogonal complement. Fun!</p>

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01921v1">Tamás Szamuely and Gergely Zábrádi, The p-adic Hodge decomposition according to Beilinson</a> is survey article of recent development in p-adic Hodge theory. I only read the introduction (it is a bit outside my comfort zone), but I really liked the appearance of the h-topology in which an algebraic version of the Poincaré lemma becomes true.</p>

<p>William Stein announces at the Benjamin Peirce centennial conference that he will <a href="http://wstein.org/papers/talks/2016-06-sage-bp/bp.pdf">leave academia</a> and focus on making a company built on top of the open-source software Sage a success (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eIoYMB_0Xc">video</a>).</p>
