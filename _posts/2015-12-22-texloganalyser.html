<p>I was doing a bit of LaTeX this morning, and whilst fixing broken references I thought that there should be a better way to navigate the log files that <var>pdflatex</var> creates. And luckily some smart people have already implemented various tools to do so. Browsing CTAN I came across <a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/texloganalyser"><var>texloganalyser</var></a>, which does a pretty good job at what I had in mind. Go check it out!</p>
<p>tl;dr: Run <code>texloganalyser -ahouvw</code> on your log file. These are the options I find the most relevant.</p>
<p><small>Also: I had the silliest idea ever. One could write a tool which turns a log file into a LaTeX file with proper layout and highlighting for code, and sectioning, and summaries, which you could then build to get the best log file reading experience <em>ever</em>.</small></p>
