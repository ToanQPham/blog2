<p>The late Alexander (Sasha) Rosenberg, has a <a href="http://sasharosenberg.com/">webpage collecting (some of) his work</a>. Of course, most of his works were available through the preprint server of the Max--Planck Institute, but  now things are easy accessible. It only went online a few days or weeks ago I think, and I guess it is maintained by his son Leo. There is also a <a href="http://newprairiepress.org/ebooks/1/">book containing selected papers</a>, which seems to be the print version of the website I linked.
<p>Enjoy!
