  <li><p><a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~tschinke/books/simons15/final/harder/AHH42.pdf">Harder&ndash;Katzarkov&ndash;Liu: Perverse sheaves of categories and non-rationality</a> is a manuscript I stumbled upon after reading <a href="https://berkeley.box.com/s/8tqjvwbgmmuv0s6225iiiwnjq8ror0ve">Andrew Harder's slides</a> about the same topic. It looks really interesting, and the connection between semiorthogonal decompositions (a subject I really like) and perverse sheaves of categories (also known as perverse schobers) seems very intriguing, but I haven't had the time yet to read it in detail. I'm not sure whether the world is supposed to be able to access this pdf, as it is supposed to be a chapter in an upcoming book, so it might disappear without notice. There are also other versions (<a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~tschinke/books/simons15/submitted/katzarkov.pdf">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~tschinke/books/simons15/submitted/harder-katzarkov.pdf">2</a>) but I guess I linked to the final one.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08852">Brent Pym, Constructions and classifications of projective Poisson varieties</a> is a <em>very</em> nice read about Poisson varieties. Read this if you care about Poisson geometry, deformation quantization or noncommutative algebraic geometry.
