<p>I just ran into 2 very interesting new LaTeX packages:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/dynkin-diagrams"><var>dynkin-diagrams</var></a>
  <li><a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/rank-2-roots"><var>rank-2-roots</var></a>
</ul>
<p>Both are by Ben McKay, and make writing something involving root systems or Dynkin diagrams <strong>much</strong> easier. The first package allows one to systematically draw all kinds of variations on Dynkin diagrams using a very powerful syntax, whilst the other makes drawing rank 2 root diagrams a walk in the park. I strongly suggest you take a look at the examples in the documentation.

<p><small>I might turn this into an irregular series of new CTAN addition highlights. Who knows.
