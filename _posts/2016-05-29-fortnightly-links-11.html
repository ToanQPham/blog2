<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05307">Goncalo Tabuada, A note on Grothendieck's (noncommutative) standard conjecture of type D</a>: I have blogged <a href="https://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/possible-noncommutative-progress-on-the-standard-conjectures/">before</a> about noncommutative motives and Grothendieck's conjectures, and this preprint discusses how the (commutative) conjecture D follows from the noncommutative version of conjecture D, which can be proven certain classes of objects whose derived categories are well-understood. Cool!

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06568v1">Alexander Kuznetsov and Alexander Perry, Derived categories of Gushel&ndash;Mukai varieties</a> is a cool preprint about a class of varieties whose birational geometry (and derived categories) are closely related to those of cubic fourfolds, about which I blogged <a href="https://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/nonrationality-of-the-generic-cubic-fourfold/">earlier</a>: as for a cubic fourfold it is expected that a generic one is not rational, which should be reflected on the level of derived categories. What is so funny about Gushel&ndash;Mukai varieties is that they are the intersection of a Grassmannian, a projective space and a quadric hypersurface, which makes them very amenable to the tools available for derived categories of varieties.

<p><a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/04/28/the-acoustics-of-kettledrums/">John D. Cook, The acoustics of kettledrums</a> explains the mathematics behind the fundamental and overtones for a kettledrum, and how an actual kettledrum (also known as tympani) needs to be not quite a theoretical kettledrum, otherwise it wouldn't be useful as an instrument!

<li>
<p><a href="http://lovelylittlelemmas.rjprojects.net/odd-degree-betti-numbers-are-even/">Remy van Dobben de Bruyn, Odd degree Betti numbers are even</a> is yet another interesting blogpost by my former classmate Remy, about computing the odd Betti numbers for proper non-projective smooth varieties over a finite field and showing that they are always even.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwwY7bBKFC4&amp;t=9m50s">President Obama gives Michael Artin a medal for his contributions to noncommutative algebraic geometry</a> is precisely what it says. Hurray for Artin and noncommutative algebraic geometry in general! Lately I've been reading lots of Artin's work on the structure of orders, and it is always a treat to read.
