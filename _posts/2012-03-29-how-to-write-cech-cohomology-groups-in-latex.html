<p>Just like <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/direct-and-inverse-limit-in-latex/">writing direct and inverse limits in TeX</a>, the way to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cech_cohomology">Čech cohomology</a> groups in TeX is something that doesn't come up easily in Google unless you know what to look for (basically a <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Accents#Math_mode">list of math mode accents</a>, but I am not the only person obstinately searching with the wrong keywords, right?).
<p>So in text mode you write <code>\v{C}ech</code>, and in case you wish to write down the $n$-th Čech cohomology group $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n(X,\mathcal{F})$ of a topological space $X$ and the sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ you use <code>\check{\mathrm{H}}^n(X,\mathcal{F})</code>. Notice the use of <code>\mathrm{H}</code> for the actual (co)homology object, you could/should do this too! 
<p><small>Don't shoot the nitpicky typesetting aficionado please. And consider using a macro like <code>\newcommand\HH{\mathrm{H}}</code> for easier typing. And of course <code>\newcommand\cHH{\check{\mathrm{H}}}</code>.</small>
<p>Let this fact be known too.
