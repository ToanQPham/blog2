<p>The original title for this blog featured music, and this year I've been working on my end year project for my music theory course which concerns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue">fugue</a> on guitar. I will discuss some of the things I've learned on this blog in the next weeks, but for now I wanted to share my excitement about the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Koshkin">Nikita Koshkin</a>'s cycle of 24 preludes and fugues. Besides the famous Castelnuovo&ndash;Tedesco cycle for 2 guitars, and Rekhin's not so famous cycle for solo guitar, this is the third such cycle for classical guitar, and based on the recordings on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nUuvxGdLGk">a minor</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQJqAxQMiY">f# minor</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5RURKrp1nY">C minor</a>) this one is amazing. Just listen to the fugue in a minor for instance, in this beautiful rendition of Asya Selyutina.
<p>So they are now available from the publisher's website:

  <li><a href="http://www.edition-margaux.de/verlag/product_info.php?info=p361_24-Preludes-and-Fugues.html">C major to B major</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.edition-margaux.de/verlag/product_info.php?info=p362_24-Preludes-and-Fugues.html">F# major to F major</a>
</ol>
<p>I hope to play through some of these preludes and fugues in the near future, and more importantly I hope there will be a full recording soon.
