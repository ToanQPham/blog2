<p>I accidentally published a draft of a post, so in case you are confused about where it has gone, you will see it soon.</p>
<p>More interesting news is that we have developed <a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/wordpress/?p=3669">a new feature for the Stacks project</a>. It is now possible to add references to the literature, as outlined in <a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/wordpress/?p=3643">References, slogans and history</a>. You will see it live later today. With this functionality in place, implementing slogans and history is a piece of cake. To see it in action, check out <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/001P">tag 001P</a> (also called Nakayama's lemma).</p>
<p>The 'we' in the previous paragraph is by the way no longer just Johan de Jong and I, but for increased confusion during mail conversations <a href="http://www.math.ru.nl/~jcommelin/">Johan Commelin</a> joined us.</p>
<p>And I have also magically made the Stacks project website up to 15 times faster. Whenever you opened a long tag view page (e.g. one that contains a whole section) the loading times were too long (more than a second, up to 4 in the worst cases...) This is now fixed. In case you think I am a guru programmer, think again, I just realised that I needed to <a href="https://github.com/stacks/stacks-tools/commit/b92948ecae7d2dbcf31c5dbc198e0c5db3adc491">put an index on a certain column</a>...</p>
