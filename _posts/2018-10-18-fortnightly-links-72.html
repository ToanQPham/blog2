  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru0Zys1Vvq4&feature=youtu.be">Billiards and tilting characters for SL3</a> is a beautiful video illustrating the billiards conjecture for $\mathrm{SL}_3$ as formulated by Lusztig&ndash;Williamson in <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3766576">Billiards and tilting characters for $\mathrm{SL}_3$</a>. If you don't wish to read the article you can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3q6C558yog">Geordie's ICM address</a> which builds up to this video.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02087v1">Olivier Debarre: Hyperkähler manifolds</a> is an overview article on (you guessed correctly) hyperkähler manifolds, with an emphasis on those which are deformations of $\operatorname{Hilb}^n\mathrm{K3}$. These have remained quite magical to me (I mostly think about the case where $\omega_X^\vee$ is ample, not trivial), but this overview definitely helps in understanding the relationship between algebraic geometry and lattice theory which appears in this setting.
