<p><a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/wordpress/?p=3815">Update from the Stacks project</a>: there is a new feature, namely slogans. Johan de Jong has <a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/wordpress/?p=3643">discussed this idea before</a>, and right now they are implemented on the website *and* there is a nice web page (compatible with your smartphone, I hope) to <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/slogans">suggest slogan</a>s. Moreover, there are numerous small bug fixes (and hopefully not too many new bugs).
<p>Hence: first <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/slogans">suggest slogans</a> and then see them appear on the Stacks project website.
<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://www.math.ru.nl/~jcommelin/">Johan</a> and Grietje Commelin for providing an excellent place to stay during the programmingathon Johan (Commelin, having multiple Johans makes for confusing mail conversations) and I did. And special thanks to their 2.5 year old daughter Hannah for the great conversations one can have with toddlers during breaks :).
