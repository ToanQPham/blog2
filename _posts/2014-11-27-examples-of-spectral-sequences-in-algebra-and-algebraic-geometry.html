<p>I just gave a lecture on examples of spectral sequences in algebra and algebraic geometry for the <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/">ANAGRAMS seminar</a> and without further ado, here are the <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/ss/examples-ag.pdf">notes</a>. Nothing new or insightful in there, just some facts and examples taken together to help me during the lecture.</p>
