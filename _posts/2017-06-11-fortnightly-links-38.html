  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00151v1">Tony Feng, Steenrod operations in étale cohomology and applications to the Brauer group of a surface over a finite field</a> is an interesting and well-written preprint. Even if you are not interested in the particular result, its introduction and appendix discuss the history of a closely related result which turned out to go through various stages of having false results and being misinterpreted for over 30 years!
  <li><p><a href="http://aperiodical.com/2017/06/13532385396179-doesnt-climb-to-a-prime/">13532385396179 doesn’t climb to a prime</a> concerns a rather esoteric conjecture by Conway, for which a reasonably small counterexample was found. It's a fun story to read.
