<p><a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/8461">The news is just out now</a>, although the rumour had been making its rounds earlier: Peter Scholze is taking up the role of director of the MPIM here in Bonn. After Hirzebruch's retirement they have had multiple directors, taking turns every few years. But with several of them retiring soon they were looking for a new director (maybe directors?), and Peter Scholze will be one of them (I have no idea whether they are looking for more).
