<p>I will be teaching a course on Hochschild (co)homology next semester, which in the German system means from April to July. It'll run for 15 weeks, with 1.5 hour lectures on Tuesday and Wednesday. For more information I created a <a href="/teaching/hh-2018">dedicated page</a>.
<p>I might discuss certain things regarding the course on my blog. In any case, I will write lecture notes, which I will post here.
