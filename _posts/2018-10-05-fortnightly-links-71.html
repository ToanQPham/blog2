<p>Apologies to all of you who were eagerly waiting for their fortnightly links, I was feeling sick and didn't feel like writing this one. On the other hand, on <a href="https://pbelmans.ncag.info/blog/2018/03/18/golyshev-periodic-table/">March 18 this year</a> I announced that I wanted to do something with Fano 3-folds, Ã  la <a href="https://superficie.info">superficie.info</a>, and in a few days I will release what I came up with.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09223">Ivan Cheltsov, Victor Przyjalkowski, Constantin Shramov: Fano threefolds with infinite automorphism groups</a> is a paper I didn't know was in progress, but that I've been waiting for. I had computed some odd cases myself, but it's great to see <em>all of them</em> done carefully.
  <p>And regarding the announcement from the introduction: I have incorporated all data on automorphism groups, so the information from this preprint will be included.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09218">Ivan Cheltsov, Victor Przyjalkowski: Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev conjecture for Fano threefolds</a> is a monumental paper, checking a conjecture regarding the behavior of Hodge numbers in mirror symmetry.
  <p>In homological mirror symmetry for Fano varieties, there is a correspondence between the Fano variety and a Landau&ndash;Ginzburg mirror, a morphism $w\colon Y\to\mathbb{A}^1$ (or compactified to $Y\to\mathbb{P}^1$), such that</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>the derived category of $X$ corresponds to the Fukaya&ndash;Seidel category of $w$
    <li><p>the Fukaya category of $X$ corresponds to the category of matrix factorisations of $w$
  </ul>
  <p>As the derived category of $X$ in the Fano case completely determines $X$ (actually, it is conjectured that Hodge numbers are derived invariants) it is therefore interesting to see whether one can recover these numbers from the symplectic geometry of $w$. The conjecture suggests a method to compute Hodge numbers on the mirror side, and this is what is checked <strong>case-by-case</strong> for all Fano 3-folds, by computing $\mathrm{h}^{1,2}$ and $\mathrm{h}^{1,1}=\operatorname{rk}\operatorname{Pic}(X)$ in this way.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10628">Joseph Karmazyn, Alexander Kuznetsov, Evgeny Shinder: Derived categories of singular surfaces</a> is a paper I did know was in progress, and that I've been waiting for. This is as far as I know (one of the) first papers in which a systematic study of semiorthogonal decompositions in a singular setting is done, where one has to be much more careful about functors as not everything automatically has all adjoints. The smooth and proper setting really is a wonderland compared to the real world. This is a very interesting read!
</ul>
