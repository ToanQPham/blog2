<p>Yesterday I got fed up with the lack of a table of contents for Thomason--Trobaugh's Higher algebraic K-theory of schemes that I decided to make one myself. The result is available as a <a href="https://pbelmans.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/toc.pdf">pdf</a>, or as a table in this blog post for your (and my) convenience:
