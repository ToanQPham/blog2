<p>A long time ago, <a href="{% post_url 2013-03-13-open-and-closed-immersions-in-tikz-cd %}">I explained how to draw arrows for open and closed immersions in <code>tikz-cd</code></a>. Back then I already mentioned that my solution is not completely satisfactory. <a href="http://haoyun.github.io/">Yun Hao</a> took up the challenge, and significantly improved my implementation.

{% highlight latex %}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.markings}

\makeatletter
\tikzcdset{
  open/.code     = {\tikzcdset{hook, circled};},
  closed/.code   = {\tikzcdset{hook, slashed};},
  open'/.code    = {\tikzcdset{hook', circled};},
  closed'/.code  = {\tikzcdset{hook', slashed};},
  circled/.code  = {\tikzcdset{markwith = {\draw (0,0) circle (.375ex);}};},
  slashed/.code  = {\tikzcdset{markwith = {\draw[-] (-.4ex,-.4ex) -- (.4ex,.4ex);}};},
  markwith/.code ={
    \pgfutil@ifundefined%
    {tikz@library@decorations.markings@loaded}%
    {\pgfutil@packageerror{tikz-cd}{You need to say %
      \string\usetikzlibrary{decorations.markings} to use arrows with markings}{}}{}%
    \pgfkeysalso{/tikz/postaction = {
      /tikz/decorate,
      /tikz/decoration={markings, mark = at position 0.5 with {#1}}}
    }
  },
}
\makeatother

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/pbelmans/20feef4708b72736187c1deef724cd9c">His example</a> produces the following result

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tikz-cd-hao.pdf"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tikz-cd-hao.png"></a>

<p>Observe that the position of the circle will be perfect in each font, whereas my solution was greatly font-dependent on how good the result was.

<p>Many thanks to him for letting sharing his code!
