  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01366">JÃ¸rgen Vold Rennemo, Ed Segal, Michel Van den Bergh: A non-commutative Bertini theorem</a> is a nice little preprint which shows that there is a Bertini-type result for noncommutative (crepant) resolutions, i.e. they show that if you have a normal variety $X$ with a coherent sheaf of algebras $\mathcal{A}$ which is a noncommutative (crepant) resolution, and a map $X\to\mathbb{P}^n$, then for a <em>generic</em> hyperplane $H\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ the fibre product $X\times_{\mathbb{P}^n}H$ together with the sheaf of algebras obtained by pullback is again a noncommutative (crepant) resolution. Cool!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00655">Anthony Blanc, Ludmil Katzarkov, Pranav Pandit: Generators in formal deformations of categories</a> concerns compact generators in triangulated ategories, one of my favourite subjects. In this paper they show that if you take a formal deformation over $k[[t]]$, then if you have a sufficiently nice compact generator downstairs, you obtain one for the deformation. It is closely related to the notion of curvature, as addressed in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03698">Wendy Lowen, Michel Van den Bergh: The curvature problem for formal and infinitesimal deformations</a>, and I'd like to really grok what is going in both papers.

  <li><p>In case you missed it (which is unlikely, given the media attention), here are <a href="https://grothendieck.umontpellier.fr/">Grothendieck's notes as collected by the University of Montpellier</a>.
