<p>This morning I discovered a <a href="http://cyexplorer.benjaminjurke.net/">super awesome visualisation of Calabi--Yau 3-folds</a>. The very same plot of Hodge numbers of Calabi--Yau 3-folds indicated 25 years ago that something like mirror symmetry could be true, and this tool is a spectacular visualisation of what is already known about mirror pairs for Calabi--Yau 3-folds. Make sure you read the documentation properly, and check out the "Open as static max zoom view" button, which gives you a plot of the whole view!
