<p><a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/jobs/vacatures/ap/2016aapfwetex112/">The mathematics department has two openings for PhD students in pure mathematics</a>. They are teaching positions, i.e. you have a bigger teaching load than your average PhD student, but to compensate this you get 6 years (3 times 2 years). This also means that you will be required to teach in Dutch the moment you start. Probably that is why there is no English version of the job openings available.</p>
<p>So if you are a 2nd year Master student in Flandres or the Netherlands (or happen to speak fluent Dutch for some other reason) looking for a PhD position, you can apply for these. If you know someone who fits this description, please spread the word.</p>
