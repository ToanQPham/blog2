<p>Via <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com">Walking Randomly</a>'s post <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=3073">Fractals on Wolfram Alpha â€“ an update</a> I stumbled upon his previous post <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=1290">Plotting Fractals with Wolfram Alpha</a>. And something struck me, I invented / discovered those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_tree">H-trees</a> when I was a little kid! I remember drawing them when I was in second grade (you're 7 years old then, at least in Belgium), enjoying the laborious yet beautiful nature of them. I also drew gigantic heaps of blocks in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_projection">oblique projection</a>, oh, how many sheets of grid paper (5 by 5 millimetre) I have filled that way... I guess I was the weird kid of our class.

<p>I wanted to board train nostalgia and draw them in TikZ. And this was even easier than I imaged, as there is a library for fractal decorations! If only TikZ did the dishes. Based on the code I found in <code>$TEXMF/tex/generic/pgf/libraries/pgflibrarydecorations.fractals.code.tex</code> I quickly hacked together the following code:

{% highlight latex %}
\pgfdeclaredecoration{H-tree}{init}
{
  \state{init}[width=\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance]
  {
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{0pt}{0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{0pt}{-0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{0pt}{0pt}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{0pt}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{-0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{0pt}}
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This code must be either placed in <code>$TEXMF/tex/generic/pgf/libraries/pgflibrarydecorations.fractals.code.tex</code> or the file itself (or your personal contain-it-all package, just someplace where it can be found).

<p>Now you just draw a <code>tikzpicture</code> with a single recursively decorated line:

{% highlight latex %}
\begin{tikzpicture}[decoration=H-tree]
  \draw decorate{decorate{decorate{decorate{decorate{decorate{ (0,0) -- (5,0) }}}}}};
\end{tikzpicture}
{% endhighlight %}

which results in
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/htree.png" alt="An H-tree, drawn in TikZ" />

<p>I hope I got the factor right, but I guess 1/(2sqrt(2)) is the one I needed. A complete minimal working example is given:
{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.fractals}

\pgfdeclaredecoration{H-tree}{init}
{
  \state{init}[width=\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance]
  {
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{0pt}{0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{0pt}{-0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{0pt}{0pt}}
	\pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{0pt}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{-0.35355\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{\pgfdecoratedinputsegmentremainingdistance}{0pt}}
  }
}

\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[decoration=H-tree, very thick]
    \draw decorate { decorate { decorate { decorate { decorate { decorate { (0,0) -- (5,0) }}}}}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

which should result in (after <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pdfcrop/"><code>pdfcrop</code></a>) <a href="http://pbelmans.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/htree-crop.pdf">this output</a>. LaTeX easily exceeds its total allocated memory, more iterations are impossible (unless you decrease the length of the line or the zooming factor, for some reason).
