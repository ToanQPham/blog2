<p><a href="http://pygments.org/docs/styles/">The documentation of Pygments on creating your own style</a> is not entirely complete (at least, I had to perform some steps that were not discussed and a comment suggests them too). So I'll discuss what extra steps are necessary (in my experience) and my own implementation of a style with <a href="http://www.ua.ac.be">my University</a>'s color scheme.

<p>First of all, locate the Pygments style folder. I don't know any more how I installed Pygments, but mine is located at <code>/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/Pygments-1.3.1-py2.6.egg/pygments/styles</code>. You could also perform a <code>locate autumn.py</code> command as that should be one of the default styles. My <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a> install also contains this folder, but you don't need that one.

<p>Now copy one of the styles and start editing it (this part is explained in Pygments' documentation). For instance, I created this first draft of a style file:
{% highlight python %}
"""
    pygments.styles.ua
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    A style based on the University of Antwerp's color scheme
"""

from pygments.style import Style
from pygments.token import Keyword, Name, Comment, String, Error, \
     Number, Operator, Whitespace

class UAStyle(Style):
    default_style = ""

    # the three main colours, as per Nico Schlömer's
    # great UniversiteitAntwerpenTheme for beamer
    uablue = '#003d64'
    uared = '#7e002f'
    vividbrown = '#d79a46'
    green = '#007e11'

    styles = {
        Whitespace:                 '#bbbbbb',

        Comment:                    '#aaaaaa',
        Comment.Preproc:            '#4c8317',
        Comment.Special:            'italic ' + uablue,

        Keyword:                    green,
        Keyword.Type:               '#00aaaa',

        Operator.Word:              green,

        Name.Builtin:               green,
        Name.Function:              uablue,
        Name.Class:                 'underline ' + vividbrown,
        Name.Namespace:             'underline ' + uablue,
        Name.Variable:              green,
        Name.Constant:              uared,
        Name.Entity:                'bold ' + uablue,
        Name.Attribute:             '#1e90ff',
        Name.Tag:                   'bold ' + uared,
        Name.Decorator:             '#888888',

        String:                     uared,
        String.Symbol:              uablue,
        String.Regex:               '#009999',

        Number:                     '#222222',

        Error:                      '#F00 bg:#FAA'
    }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you can see I made the colours consistent with the colours used in <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~nschloe/">Nico Schlömer</a>'s <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~nschloe/content/ua-beamer-theme">beamer theme</a>.
<p><del>This file must be saved in the aforementioned styles directory. Now edit <code>__init__.py</code>, where the dictionary <code>STYLES_MAP</code> should contain a line <code>'ua': 'ua::UAStyle',</code>. Although the documentation (and code, on a quick inspection) suggests it should be able to find styles automatically, it doesn't, as is proved by this LaTeX error:</del>
{% highlight output %}
! Undefined control sequence.
 \PY
               {n}{P}\PY {o}{.} \P...
l.2 ...\PY{n}{QQ}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+m+mi}{2}\PY{p}{)}
{% endhighlight %}
<p><del>
In case you're writing your own style, the key in the dictionary is the name used in your LaTeX document (so mine reads <code>\usemintedstyle{ua}</code>) while the part in front of <code>::</code> is the filename and the part behind it the Python file your style is located in.</del>
<p><ins datetime="2012-05-14T18:59:19+00:00">All information is available at <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/ua-pygments-style">github.com/pbelmans/ua-pygments-style</a>, including installation information. The previous should be considered obsolete.
<p>Now running <code>pdflatex</code> on your document that uses the <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/minted"><code>minted</code> package</a> should provide you with your customized colour scheme.
<p>I'm not yet entirely happy with how the theme comes out at the moment: not enough contrast and only three colours. I should find a matching green and use it too, but for now this post can be used as a starter for anyone interested (I suspect the collaborator for my Bachelor theses will enjoy this write-up) in getting his code in our University's colour scheme :).</ins>
