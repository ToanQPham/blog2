<p>As hinted in <a href="{% post_url 2011-06-19-solutions-to-tennisons-sheaf-theory %}" title="Solutions to Tennison’s Sheaf theory">Solutions to Tennison's Sheaf theory</a> I have been enjoying myself the last couple of days with <a href="http://math216.wordpress.com/">Math 216: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry</a> by Ravi Vakil. At this moment, I have partial (but nearing completion) solutions to Chapters 2, 3 and 4. Of course, some the remaining chapters will follow, I've got a printout up to Chapter 7, I'm intending to make all (or most) of the exercises in there before university starts. I'm not sure how far I will take this effort, it'll depend on my workload for university.
<p>Everything is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/math216">this GitHub project</a>. Read the disclaimer in <code>solutions.tex</code> (or build the file) and any suggestions are very welcome.
