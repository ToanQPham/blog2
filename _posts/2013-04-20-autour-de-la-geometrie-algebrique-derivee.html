<p>Time for a little commercial break. A seminar in which I've been participating now has its own <a href="http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~vezzosi/seminar/">webpage</a>, containing the set of <a href="http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~vezzosi/seminar/notes.pdf">notes</a> people have written for this seminar. After April 26 there will be a short break, May 17 it will restart. That day I might or might not give a lecture on derived moduli stacks. Feel free to come if you are interested.
<p><small>All remarks on the layout of the webpage (which I realize is rather bare, but I wasn't feeling inspired and I'm a lousy webdesigner anyway) and the notes are appreciated.</small>
