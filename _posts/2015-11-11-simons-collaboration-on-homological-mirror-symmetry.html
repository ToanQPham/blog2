<p>Besides all the Breakthrough Prize money being thrown around there is a more sensible way of investing in mathematics, such as <a href="https://schms.math.berkeley.edu/">the Simons Foundation sponsoring a very interesting collaboration on homological mirror symmetry</a>. The inaugural event was last week, <a href="https://schms.math.berkeley.edu/slides-and-videos-from-inaugural-conference/">slides and videos are now available</a>.</p>
