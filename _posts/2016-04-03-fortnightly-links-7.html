<p>This fortnight's interesting reads.
<ul>
<li>
<p>A while ago I blogged about <a href="https://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/on-towards-mathjax-3-0/">the future of MathJax</a>. One of the main points in that white paper is that MathML does not seem to be catching on as a web standard, and that MathJax should not be built based on the idea that wide-spread MathML adaptation in browsers is going to be here any time soon.
<p>Continuing on this thought, Peter Krautzberger, who is one of the lead developers of MathJax, wrote a very interesting blog post <a href="https://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0186/">MathML is a failed web standard</a> describing exactly why it failed to be implemented, motivating some of the design choices discussed in "On towards MathJax 3.0".
<p>Also very interesting is Paul Topping's answer to Peter's blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/@PaulTopping/response-to-peter-krautzberger-s-mathml-is-a-failed-web-standard-179ab8ffa24b#.mx2qy1a69">Response to Peter Krautzbergerâ€™s "MathML is a failed web standard"</a>.

<li>
<p>Ed Segal's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06717">All autoequivalences are spherical twists</a> is a fun to read preprint about how every autoequivalence can be constructed as a spherical twist by using a monad construction.

<li>
<p><a href="https://picturethismaths.wordpress.com/">Picture this maths</a> is a weblog I just discovered. Check it out!
