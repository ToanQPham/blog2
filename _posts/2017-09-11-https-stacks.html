<p>Google has announced that it will <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/avoid-not-secure-warn#long_term_-_use_https_everywhere">display security warnings for all pages containing input forms</a>. They already do this for input fields meant for passwords or credit card details, but in October it will apply to all possible input forms, and we have quite a few of those.
<p>To prevent Chrome from displaying warnings, we have now moved everything to HTTPS. There shouldn't be anything different, except that you see your browser stating that the website is served over a secure connection. Everything automatically redirects, so you don't have to do anything special.
<p>Please let me know if you find something which doesn't work anymore.
