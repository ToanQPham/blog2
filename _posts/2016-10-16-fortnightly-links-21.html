  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09540">Yujiro Kawamata, Derived McKay correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{C})$</a> is the generalisation of the famous <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1824990">Bridgeland&ndash;King&ndash;Reid McKay correspondence for $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$</a>. In this case it is not just an equivalence of the derived category of the quotient stack with the derived category of a crepant resolution, because the elements of the finite subgroup $G\subset\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{C})$ not contained in $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$ will contribute (relative) exceptional objects, which are described explicitly and which depend in a complicated way on the subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^3$ fixed by those elements. Cool!

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02771">Arnaud Beauville, An introduction to Ulrich bundles</a> is precisely what I wanted to write, but of course infinitely better. I have come across Ulrich bundles a few times now, but only in the titles of talks that I didn't attend or papers I haven't read, hence I planned on doing an outsider's attempt at a <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/notices/whatis/noticesarchive">What is...</a> column on Ulrich bundles to figure out what was going on, but I will now refer you to his overview paper. One thing I would still like to figure out is the role of Ulrich bundles in the context of derived categories, besides the possible coincidence that indecomposable Ulrich bundles on a quadric are related to spinor bundles.

  <li>From time to time I am confronted with the awesomeness of finite group theory, and this time it's by <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/index.html">GroupNames</a> which gives an overview of the structure of finite groups of sufficiently small order, explaining how various classes are defined and what the properties of its members are.
