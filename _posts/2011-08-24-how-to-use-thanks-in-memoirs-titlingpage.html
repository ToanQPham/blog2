<p>I was fiddling with <code>memoir</code>'s <code>titlingpage</code> and wanted functionality for the <code>\thanks</code> macro. This is normally handled by <code>\maketitle</code>, but we're bypassing this construction. Section 4.2 of the (otherwise excellent) <code>memoir</code> manual doesn't state anything on how to actually implement this behaviour yourself.
<p>After a bit of fiddling with <code>memoir.dtx</code> (any <code>.dtx</code> file is the <em>documented source</em> of a LaTeX package or class) I hacked together the desired result. A bit of <code>\makeatletter</code> magic and calling the correct macros did what I wanted.
<p>For future reference, here it is.
<p>If you want to change the marker using <code>\thanksmarkseries{...}</code>, start your <code>titlingpage</code> environment with the following:<br />
[sourcecode language="latex" wraplines="false"]\thanksmarkseries{alph}<br />
\makeatletter<br />
\@bsmarkseries<br />
\makeatother[/sourcecode]
<p>The main part of the solution simply is to mention
<p>[sourcecode language="latex" wraplines="false"]\makeatletter<br />
\usethanksrule<br />
\@thanks<br />
\makeatother[/sourcecode]
<p>at the end of the <code>titlingpage</code> environment. Note that <code>\usethanksrule</code> is not necessary but it feels better to have it.
<p><small>There is the undocumented <code>\saythanks</code> macro though, but it is buggy: it always uses <code>fnsymbol</code> as its marker for the actual footnote. Behaviour that could be fixed I presume.</small>
