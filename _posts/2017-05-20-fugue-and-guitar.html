<p>The past few months I have written <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fugue-guitar.pdf">the final project for my music theory course</a>. It concerns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue">the fugue</a> as a musical form, on the classical guitar. I did three things:
<ol>
  <li>an introduction to the fugue, using examples from the guitar literature
  <li>a detailed structural analysis of 3 important fugues in the guitar literature:
    <ol>
      <li>the fugue from Bach's third violin sonata
      <li>the fugue from Ponce's <em>Folia de Espa&ntilde;a</em>
      <li>the fugue from Castelnuovo--Tedesco's <em>Fuga elegiaca</em>
    </ol>
  <li>a global comparison between Castelnuovo--Tedesco's 24 preludes and fugues (<em>Les guitares bien tempérées</em>) and Bach's 48 preludes and fugues from <em>Das wohltemperierte Klavier</em>
</ol>

<p>One possible downside might of course be that it is in Dutch. If you are interested in something specific, but don't read Dutch just ask. I will also discuss certain aspects of it on my blog later on.
