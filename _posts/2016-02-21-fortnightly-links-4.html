<p>Another fortnight has passed.
<ul>
<li>
<p>The past 3 weeks we were hosting the IMAGINARY exhibition at the University of Antwerp, and one of the items was related to the fact that there are 27 lines on a cubic surface. <a href="http://blogs.ams.org/visualinsight/2016/02/15/27-lines-on-a-cubic-surface/">John Baez now has a description and some pretty visualisations of the Clebsch surface on his AMS Blog "Visual Insight"</a>. There are other really cool visualisations on this blog, new ones are posted every 1st and 15th of the month.

<li>
<p>I like using MathSciNet and zbMath, and sometimes a review (often negative) can be fun to read. There is a <a href="http://www2.math.ou.edu/~kmartin/mr.html">page dedicated to these exceptional MathReviews</a>. You'll need a subscription to read the actual reviews though. Related to this is <a href="http://blogs.ams.org/beyondreviews/">Edward Dunne's Beyond Reviews blog</a>, which discusses reviews that are really worth reading (and not because the reviewer eloquently describes where the authors went wrong as for the first link).

<li>
<p>The Aperiodical has a post in which <a href="http://aperiodical.com/2016/02/maths-object-groups-by-georges-papy/">Christian thumbs through a beautiful and intriguing book of Georges Papy about group theory</a>. It gets interesting at the 1:20 mark, where he reads the preface and the author turns out this book is supposedly written to be used by high school teachers.
<p>It gets even more interesting when you realise that Georges Papy actually was responsible for the reform of the mathematics education in Belgium in the 1960s! When I was in elementary and secondary school in the late 1990s, early 2000s there were still some remnants of his influence visible (I can only presume). For example: I guess (or hope) that no-one outside Belgium had to learn the lists of axioms for groups, rings and fields by heart at the age of 11--12 without ever seeing any example of these (at that time) besides the integers and the rationals. Although I do fear that Bourbaki's influence might have scarred the maths education outside Belgium too in this particular way.
<p>Also, some older people in Belgium, when you confess that you are a mathematician, will tell you stories of how they were either subjected to the wonders (or horrors) of Papy's "New Maths", or how they were just a few years too old and were raised in the ignorance that is a maths education not firmly based on Bourbaki whilst their younger siblings became part of the horde of the mathematically enlightened.

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201603/rnoti-p242.pdf">There is another article about Grothendieck</a>, this time featuring recollections by 12 mathematicians who were (very) close to him.
<p>One story I'd like to highlight is from Robin Hartshorne, who wrote "Residues and duality" based on notes of Grothendieck. After its publication, Grothendieck asked him
<blockquote><p>"Well, those lecture notes were a good rough account, but when are you going to write the book on duality?"</blockquote>

<li>
<p>It was published 3 weeks ago, but I only discovered it today: <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/culpublic/arXiv+Update+-+January+2016">a news update from the arXiv</a>. Interesting point: they will update their TeX installation and improve its documentation this year. Hurray! See also the <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/culpublic/2016+arXiv+Roadmap">2016 roadmap for more information</a>.
