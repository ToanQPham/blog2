  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05318">Osamu Iyama, Tilting Cohen&ndash;Macaulay representations</a> is another ICM address (this one appeared much later than the others?) Besides being a well-written overview, it has a rather high quiver-to-page ratio.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05174">Igor Burban and Yuriy Drozd, Non-commutative nodal curves and derived tame algebras</a> is a nice article to read after you've read Iyama's ICM address: it concerns the derived categories of singular curves and sheaves of orders on them. Just like Geigle&ndash;Lenzing canonical algebras can be studied using weighted projective lines (or vice versa), one can study derived tame algebras using algebraic geometry.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05501">Bhargav Bhatt, Jacob Lurie and Akhil Mathew, Revisiting the de Rham&ndash;Witt complex</a> gives an alternative construction of the de Rham&ndash;Witt complex: in part 1 this is done for algebras using only elementary methods, whilst part 2 invokes all the $\infty$-language to do descent theory (and more). I saw Jacob give a talk about (the first part of) this paper at the <a href="https://stacks.github.io/">Stacks project workshop</a> where he started with the memorable statement <q>There will be <strong>no</strong> homotopy theory in this talk</a>.
