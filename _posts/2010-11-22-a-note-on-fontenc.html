<p>Even when I'm not typing LaTeX but e.g. an e-mail I automatically write <code>\"</code> for trema's and similar for other diacritics, but most people want to type the actual characters directly in their source document, i.e., <code>GÃ¶del</code> instead of <code>G\"odel</code>. Fair enough, that's why we have <code>\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}</code>. Just one little thing to remember: it doesn't work out of the box with regular Computer Modern, also known as <em>the</em> LaTeX font (<em>the</em> dead give-away to a document being typeset using LaTeX) and most people don't know how to use (non-bitmap) fonts, let alone know it is possible.
<p>So, how to use Computer Modern with <code>fontenc</code>? Just install the <code>cm-super</code> fonts, or add <code>\usepackage{lmodern}</code>. You get Latin Modern with the latter, but that's just a Computer Modern v2.0: more diacritics and some other alphabets (no AJAX or drop shadows though). That's it for today.
