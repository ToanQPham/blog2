  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06344v1">Alice Rizzardo and Michel Van den Bergh: A $k$-linear triangulated category without a model</a> gives an example of (drumroll...) a $k$-linear triangulated category without a model, i.e. without an enhancement (as a dg category, or equivalently an $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-category), where $k$ is a field.
    <p>It nicely complements the earlier (and much easier) preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00830v3">A note on non-unique enhancements</a> by the same authors, where an example of $k$-linear triangulated category is given with two enhancements.
    <p>Are there more possible pathologies of triangulated categories, linear over a field, that aren't resolved yet?

  <li><p><a href="https://math.columbia.edu/~rdobben/Preprint/">Remy van Dobben de Bruyn's preprints and drafts</a> are available on his personal webpage. If you like your algebraic geometry to be done over fields of positive characteristic, then you're in for a treat, with some really nice results.

  <li><p><a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/plot.html">Tutorial: visualizing root systems</a> is a tutorial for (drumroll...) visualising root systems in Sage. It is really useful that you can draw these things to get a feel for what the computations in a root system look like, and the results look stunning.
