<p>During our <a href="https://anagrams-seminar.github.io">seminar</a> on Wednesday about weighted projective spaces we wondered how singular weighted projective spaces are precisely. First of all, they are always Cohen&ndash;Macaulay. So the next question could be: when are they Gorenstein? For this question there is a purely numerical criterion in terms of the weights:
<p><strong>Fact</strong> The weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(q_0,\dotsc,q_n)$ is Gorenstein if and only if $q_i\,\mid\,\sum_{i=0}^nq_i$.
<p>So I quickly wrote a silly Python script which iterates over all possible weights up to a certain limit, only considered the normalised ones (i.e. to consider them up to isomorphism) and see how many of these satisfy the condition. It turned out that there are 3 Gorenstein weighted $\mathbb{P}^2$'s, and 14 Gorenstein weighted $\mathbb{P}^3$'s.
<p>Actually, looking for weights $(q_0,\dotsc,q_n)$ for which $q_0\leq q_1\leq\ldots\leq q_n$ satisfies the condition can be rewritten as a diophantine equation: if $(q_0,\dotsc,q_n)$ is a set of weights such that the associated weighted projective space is Gorenstein, then we will denote
$$x_j=q_j^{-1}\sum_{i=0}^nq_i.$$
<p>Then as explained at the end of section&nbsp;2 of <a href="https://www.math.uzh.ch/fileadmin/math/preprints/21-06.pdf">Samuel Bossi√®re, &Eacute;tienne Mann and Fabio Perroni, On the cohomological crepant resolution conjecture for weighted projective spaces</a> we have that
$$\sum_{i=0}^n\frac{1}{x_i}=1,$$
and for such a solution we can also go back to a set of weights.
<p>The solutions to this equation are known as <em>Egyptian fractions</em>, and there is an <a href="http://oeis.org/A002966">OEIS sequence</a> telling us precisely how many there are.

<p><strong>Followup question</strong> When is $\mathbb{P}(q_0,\dotsc,q_n)$ actually a complete intersection? The easiest non-trivial weighted projective plane is $\mathbb{P}(1,1,2)$, which is isomorphic to the quadric cone $\mathbb{V}(xy-z^2)$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$. On the other hand, the only remaining Gorenstein case is $\mathbb{P}(1,2,3)$, which based on the computation on page 128 of Harris's Algebraic Geometry textbook does not seem to be a complete intersection. What happens in for weighted $\mathbb{P}^3$'s?
