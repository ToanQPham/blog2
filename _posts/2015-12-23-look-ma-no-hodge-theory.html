<p>Max Lieblich has <a href="http://max.lieblich.us/">a blog</a>, and a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06451">preprint</a> together with Martin Olsson, and <a href="http://max.lieblich.us/research/2015/12/22/derived-Torelli.html">he discusses the latter on the former</a>. Go check it out!
<p><small>Maybe I ought to do a similar thing, discussing my own preprints, but I just don't think there is a sufficiently big audience for it...</small>
