<p>Yes, I am still alive. Today I would like to announce a new series of lectures in our <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/">graduate student seminar</a>. We are going to talk about <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/hdr.html">Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration</a>, and the proof of Deligne--Illusie of this. Feel free to join in if you are interested, and somewhere in the neighbourhood of Antwerp.
