<p>More fortnightly links.
<ul>
<li>I announced this already via Google+, but let's to it here too. We are <a href="http://win.uantwerpen.be/ncdhmig/">organising a conference at the University of Antwerp</a>. If you are part of the mathematical audience of this blog, you might be interested in attending. The list of speakers is frikkin' awesome so far.

<li><a href="https://schms.math.berkeley.edu/slides-and-videos-from-miami-conference-available/">The slides and videos for the Miami conference on mirror symmetry are available</a>. The cubic fourfolds from an earlier post (whose rationality is still open it turns out: the paper was retracted) make a guest appearance in Orlov's lecture, around the 38 minute mark, and during the question session.

<li><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=4000">A comic on how to teach math</a>. There is also the <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/teaching-mathematics">following related joke by the neverending author</a>.

</ul>
