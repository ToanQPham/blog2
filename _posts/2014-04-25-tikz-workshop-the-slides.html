<p>Yesterday I gave the TikZ workshop <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/announcement-tikz-workshop/">announced in the previous post</a>. I liked it, I hope the same applies to the people in the audience. It certainly wasn't intended as a thorough introduction to the intricacies of the TikZ syntax, more a "learn to use these resources", a show-off of what is possible, and a freewheeling through some examples allowing me to explain some of the important things in creating TikZ / pgfplots figures.
<p>As promised: <a href="http://pbelmans.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/handout.pdf">the slides</a> (and the <a href="http://pbelmans.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/slides.pdf">non-handout version</a>). For those who are interested in the actual source code required to produce these slides: I have put <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/tikz-workshop">the code on GitHub</a>. LuaLaTeX is required.
