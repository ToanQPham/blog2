<p>Because I just keep on forgetting the conditions under which it is known when $\mathbf{D}(\mathop{\mathrm{Qcoh}}X)$ is generated by a single perfect complex (where $X$ is allowed to be an algebraic stack) I decided to write a quick summary post about the state of the art.
<p>I phrase the question in a specific way: for the sake of this blogpost I am only interested in $\mathbf{D}(\mathop{\mathrm{Qcoh}}X)$. One can also consider $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{qc}}(\mathcal{O}_X)$, the derived category of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules whose cohomologies are all quasicoherent, which under suitable hypotheses is equivalent to the derived category of quasicoherent sheaves via the natural functor $\mathbf{D}(\mathop{\mathrm{Qcoh}}X)\to\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{qc}}(\mathcal{O}_X)$. But for the sake of this post, $\mathbf{D}(\mathop{\mathrm{Qcoh}}X)$ is the main player.
<h2>When $X$ is a scheme</h2>
<p>In this case the result holds if $X$ is <strong>quasicompact</strong> and <strong>has affine diagonal</strong>.
<p>It is already classical, and due to <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1308405">Neeman (1996)</a>, although for the statement that there is a single perfect complex that acts as a compact generator one has to refer to <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1996800">Bondal--Van den Bergh (2003)</a>.
<p>In the Stacks project it is given in <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09IS">tag 09IS</a>. Observe that the statement is for $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{qc}}(\mathcal{O}_X)$, but assuming quasicompact and having affine diagonal these categories turn out to be equivalent, which was proven in <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1214458">BÃ¶kstedt--Neeman (1993)</a> for the quasicompact separated case, and in <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08DB">tag 08DB</a> in the Stacks project assuming affine diagonal.
<h2>When $X$ is an algebraic space</h2>
<p>In this case the result holds if $X$ is <strong>quasicompact</strong> and <strong>has affine diagonal</strong>.
<p>This result is not published, but is due to Van den Bergh, from 2005.
<p>In the Stacks project it is given in <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09IY">tag 09IY</a>. Observe that the statement is for $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{qc}}(\mathcal{O}_X)$, but assuming quasicompact and affine diagonal these turn out to be equivalent, which is given in <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08H1">tag 08H1</a>.
<h2>When $X$ is an algebraic stack</h2>
<p>In this case the result holds if $X$ is <strong>quasicompact</strong> and <strong>has affine<sup>1</sup> and quasi-finite diagonal</strong>.
<p>In particular, if I'm not mistaken the result applies to quasicompact Deligne--Mumford stacks having affine diagonal: by definition these have an unramified diagonal, and unramified implies quasi-finite (everything being quasicompact).
<p>The result in this case is again a combination of knowing when the natural functor is an equivalence, and when the codomain is compactly generated by a single perfect complex. The results in the literature are:
<ol>
<li><em>$\Psi_X$ is an equivalence</em> if $X$ is quasicompact and has affine diagonal, provided (!) $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{qc}}(\mathcal{O}_X)$ is compactly generated. So compact generation of this category becomes now important for two reasons. This is theorem 1.2 in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1888">Hall--Neeman--Rydh</a>.

<li><em>$\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{qc}}(\mathcal{O}_X)$ is compactly generated by a single perfect complex</em> if $X$ is quasicompact and has quasifinite separated diagonal. This is theorem B in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1887v2">Hall--Rydh</a>.

</ol>
<p>There are more general situations in which $\Psi_X$ is an equivalence, the harder question is to have a single compact generator, and one cannot expect such a thing in general for an algebraic stack not having suitable finiteness properties, as one can conclude by considering $\mathrm{B}\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}$ which needs a countable set of compact generators.
<p>The main conclusion of this post is probably that I should dedicate a blogpost (or even several) to the wonderful properties of diagonals.
