<p>What a treat, a fortnightly links which is actually posted on Sunday (as I intend it every time).

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07830v1">Alberto Canonaco, Mattia Ornaghi, Paolo Stellari: Localizations of the category of $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-categories and internal Homs</a> is a preprint proving the fundamental result that it doesn't matter whether you use dg categories, strictly unital $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-categories or cohomologically unital $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-categories (as long as you do everything up to quasi-equivalence). As an application they give a proof for a claim of Kontsevich, that the dg category of strictly unital $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-functors between 2 dg categories is a model for the internal Hom. A proof of this claim was first given by Faonte, but they point out some issues in the original proof.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07379v1">Daniel Bragg: Derived equivalences of twisted supersingular K3 surfaces</a> discusses a class of K3 surfaces which only exist in characteristic $p$, and are characterised by the rank $\rho$ of their Picard group being 22 (compared to the maximum of 20 in characteristic 0). The Brauer group of such surfaces behaves totally differently, instead of being isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})^{22-\rho}$ it is isomorphic to the underlying additive group of the field $k$. This makes the analogue of the twisted derived Torelli theorem in finite characteristic behave differently, but using crystalline cohomology one can prove its analogue.
  <p>My favourite result is probably theorem 4.4.6, which gives the number of twisted Fourier&ndash;Mukai partners, in terms of the Artin invariant (which takes on values on from 1 to 11), involving powers of the characteristic.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04440">Marco Antonio Armenta, Bernhard Keller: Derived invariance of the Tamarkin--Tsygan calculus of an algebra</a> shows that the pair $(\operatorname{HH}^\bullet(A),\operatorname{HH}_\bullet(A))$ with its Tamarkan&ndash;Tsygan calculus is a derived invariant. This is a result I wanted to see for quite some time! Next up, proving it for arbitrary dg categories (provided it is true in that generality of course).

  <li>
    <p>Homological projective duality is a wonderful machine, and I'd love to understand it much better. Anyone up for a seminar in Bonn? Recently, 2 more foundational papers have appeared:
    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05135v1">Qingyuan Jiang, Naichung Conan Leung: Categorical duality between joins and intersections</a>
      <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05132v1">Qingyuan Jiang, Naichung Conan Leung: Blowing up linear categories, refinements, and homological projective duality with base locus</a>
    </ul>
    <p>One can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVIq4-m5yzw">the short talk the first author gave</a> introducing this subject.
</ul>
