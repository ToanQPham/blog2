<p><a href="http://gael-math.org/sites/default/files/private/ToricGAeL.pdf">Cox, Toric varieties</a> are the lectures notes that David Cox wrote for his lecture series at this year's GAeL. I wasn't there for the conference, but the lectures notes are definitely worth a read.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=8659">Woit, Quantum Theory and Representation Theory, the Book</a> is the blog post announcing Peter's upcoming book. The pdf of the current version is freely available. This is one of the things I would like to learn more about, if only I could read and understand things faster.</p>

<li>
<p>To end this fortnight's list of links: <a href="http://projects.thestar.com/math-the-canadian-who-reinvented-mathematics/">The Canadian who reinvented mathematics</a> is a nice and interesting piece about Robert Langlands. It's a bit annoying though how the journalist likes to stress how little he remembers from high school mathematics...</p>
