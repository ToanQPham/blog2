  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05679v1">Enrico Fatighenti, Giovanni Mongardi: Fano varieties of K3 type and IHS manifolds</a> is a very interestingn preprint, constructing many new examples where it can be expected that the geometry of a Fano variety and associated hyperk√§hler varieties is controlled by an admissible subcategory in the derived category. This phenomenon was first studied for cubic fourfolds and Gushel&ndash;Mukai fourfolds, and I'm looking forward to seeing these other cases being studied.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04803">Daniel Bragg, Max Lieblich: Perfect points on genus one curves and consequences for supersingular K3 surfaces</a> explains how the proof of Artin's conjecture might not be a proof after all. This conjecture states that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersingular_K3_surface">supersingular K3 surfaces</a> (which only exist in positive characteristic) are unirational (i.e. there is a dominant map from $\mathbb{P}^2$ onto the surface).

  <li><p><a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201904/rnoti-p483.pdf">Timothy Perutz: The mirror's magic sights: an update on mirror symmetry</a> is a wonderful introduction to mirror symmetry, covering its origin in physics, explaining the algebraic and symplectic geometry aspects, and recent developments.

  <p>He also writes <q>In this account I have not even touched on mirror symmetry for Fano manifolds [...]</q>, so let's hope mirror symmetry for them gets an equally nice article soon.
