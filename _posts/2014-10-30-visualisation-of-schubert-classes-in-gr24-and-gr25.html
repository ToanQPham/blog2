<p>We are still doing <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/what-are-chern-classes/">Chern classes</a> in the <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/">seminar</a>, and today I'm speaking about the multiplicative structure of the Chow ring of a Grassmannian. It'll include some example computations, for which I prepared a little handout. Without further ado, <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/chern/schubert.pdf">here it is</a>. It's not that spectacular, and certainly not original (it is based on the visualisation I found in 3264 and all that).</p>
<p>The actual weekly blogpost will go online tonight, and it will feature rational surface singularities.</p>
