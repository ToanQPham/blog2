<p>Or rather, do you want to be a PhD student in quadratic form theory at the University of Antwerp? Because I will have left by the time you'd begin, we'd be colleagues for at most 2 months (but that's not why you should apply for this position). In any case, they are looking for <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/jobs/vacatures/ap/2017bapfwetef116/">one person in algebra</a>.
