<p>For the new Stacks project website I created <a href="https://gerby-project.github.io/">Gerby</a>, a combination of a plasTeX fork and a Flask website to create online views for large LaTeX documents with a permanent reference system (also known as tags). From the beginning we intended it to be applicable to at least 1 other project: an online view for the works of <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/">Jacob Lurie</a>.
<p>This is now live, as <strong><a href="https://kerodon.net">Kerodon</a></strong>. Currently it contains 1 chapter: <a href="https://kerodon.net/tag/0001">The Language of $\infty$-Categories</a>. Gradually this will increase, as more material is prepared to be included in Kerodon.
<p>Let me know if you have comments or suggestions.

<p><small>It's a complete coincidence that Fanography and Kerodon were released just 2 days apart, as Kerodon has been in the making for more than a year (although the hard work only started 2 months ago). I will give you fortnightly links tomorrow.
