<p>Yes, it's quite unbelievable, yet true. Please look at the announcing blog post: <a href="http://b4winckler.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/using-the-conceal-vim-feature-with-latex/">Using the conceal Vim feature with LaTeX</a> by the person responsible for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>. To give credit where credit's due: <a href="http://www.charlietanksley.net/philtex/vim-latex-conceal/">Vim, LaTeX and 'conceal'</a> made me aware of this.
<p>It basically gives you a preview, but not via a build using <code>pdflatex</code> or similar, it happens on the spot using Unicode. I'm not saying I will be using this feature often (I have yet to install Vim 7.3), but I feel this might be interesting when editing a document: when you're writing complex formulas you are aware of everything you're doing at that moment, but afterwards that knowledge is gone.
