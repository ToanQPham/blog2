<p>I should've made this announcement sooner, but today I am giving an introductory workshop to TikZ (and friends). It is organised by my friends of <a href="http://prime.ugent.be/">PRIME</a> and takes place today (Thursday, April 24) at 17h30 in room Turing, of building S9 on the Sterre campus of Ghent University. Everyone can attend, but it will be in Dutch. Afterwards I will post the slides online.
