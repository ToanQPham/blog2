<p>Just when you think TeX and TikZ have reached their respective limit, there is someone pushing its boundaries. <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5959/cool-text-highlighting-in-latex/6029#6029">Antal S-Z's answer to Cool Text Highlighting in LaTeX</a> (one of the lesser titles on <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com">TeX.se</a> in my opinion) is just sheer awesomeness.</p>
<p>What they basically want to achieve is the visual effect of a person highlighting text using a text marker. And as humans are not that good in drawing straight lines, the highlighting is wiggly. So to give a document a more natural look, one could opt for these wiggly marker lines instead of <a href="http://pkg.ctan.org/soul"><code>soul</code></a>'s squarish output.</p>
<p>So after some amazing TeX hacking, his example output<sup>1</sup>:<br />

<p>Is this amazing or what? For howto's and such, please look at his answer.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> I guess there's nothing wrong with hotlinking this, if there <em>is</em> a problem though, please tell me so.</p>
