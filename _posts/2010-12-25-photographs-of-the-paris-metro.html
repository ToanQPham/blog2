<p>As I opened this blog with a (rather silly) description of my trip to Paris, almost 4 months ago, I guess this is a nice sequel to it. <a href="http://www.sleepycity.net/">Some urban photographers</a> have taken pictures in the unused parts of the Paris metro, see <a href="http://www.sleepycity.net/posts/252/Demolition_of_the_Paris_Metro">Demolition of the Paris Metro</a>. I don't know what it is, but urban photography is such an interesting concept. I don't know whether it is cheap and easy as a subject or not, but I like it. My personal favourite for sightseeing (I'm no photographer) is the unused canal in a village nearby and any excavation for a large building. Please don't laugh at me when you see me drooling over an excavation (which I feel is a lousy translation for the Dutch 'bouwput' which literally translates to 'building pit', any suggestions?).
<p>Found via <a href="http://kottke.org/10/12/a-tour-of-the-abandoned-paris-metro">kottke.org</a> by the way.
