<p>I repeat, <code>\twoheadrightarrow</code> is in <code>amssymb</code>. Just so you know, this isn't obvious (to me) from the <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf">symbols list</a>.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2011-01-03T16:19:04+00:00">Apparently <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org">Detexify</a> can interpret my awful drawing skills nowadays, but I tell you, back then it didn't know the symbol! :)</ins></p>
