<p>The title of my blog suggests that I should be talking about music, but I don't often do this. For those who wish to read about music and mathematics, consider adding <a href="https://alpof.wordpress.com/">alpof</a> to your aggregators. He writes both about the stuff I would like to write about (tuning theory) and about the stuff I would like to understand (neo-Riemannian music theory).
