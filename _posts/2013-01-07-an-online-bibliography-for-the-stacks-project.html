<p>Ever found yourself browsing the <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu">Stacks project</a> and encountering a citation? I did, and I found it quite annoying that I couldn't get any information, unless I opened the bibliography file and started looking for the reference. Not really user-friendly... So I decided to implement an online bibliography :).
<p>The <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/bibliography">bibliography overview page</a> contains all items from the bibliography, and whenever a work is cited in the text, see for instance <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03B3">tag 03B3</a> you get a link to the page of that particular item.
<p>At some point this will be improved, parsing arXiv links, making things more consistent, giving overviews per author (maybe), etc. But for now everything is quite workable I hope.
