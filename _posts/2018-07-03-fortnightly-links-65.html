  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08281v1">Lev Borisov, Dmitri Orlov: Equivariant exceptional collections on smooth toric stacks</a> describes the derived categories of Artin stacks, obtained by taking the quotient stack by the torus action on a smooth toric Deligne&ndash;Mumford stack. It turns out that they have full exceptional collections, but which (unlike the usual case) consist of infinitely many objects. There is also a noncommutative version for graded algebras, where the role of the derived category of graded modules is emphasised.

  <li><p><a href="http://indico.ictp.it/event/8319/material/5/0.pdf">Angela Gibney, Conformal blocks and the moduli space of curves</a> is a set of lecture notes from a summer school 2 weeks ago. If I had a little more time I would love to read these in detail.

  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OokyTw9mYYc">Entretien avec Ofer Gabber</a> is an interview (in English) with Ofer Gabber, where Luc Illusie is asking the questions. One interesting point is around 16:10, where he discusses how he dealt with some issues he found in Bourbaki.
