<p>I just came back from <a href="http://www.sfb45.de/events/summer-school-algebraic-stacks-and-related-topics">a really good summer school on algebraic stacks</a>, and the good thing is that there are some excellent notes to be shared. Jarod Alper wrote <a href="https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~alperj/papers/mainz.pdf">his own notes</a> for his lectures, and these are a brilliant introduction to Artin approximation and Artin algebraization leading to a description of the local structure of algebraic stacks. For the other lectures participants are TeX'ing up their notes, so far <a href="http://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~holmesdst/Vistoli_torsors.pdf">Vistoli's lectures on gerbes</a> (done by David Holmes) are available, stay tuned for the others as all of the lecture series were really good and worth a read if you are interested in algebraic stacks.
