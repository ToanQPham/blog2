<p>Just a quick update: there is now a (preliminary) list of mentors available on the <a href="https://stacks.github.io/">website for the Stacks Project Workshop</a>. It looks awesome, and if you are interested in attending you can still let us know what you would like to see at the workshop, by filling out the form on the website.
