  <li><p>Two preprints on the Grothendieck ring of geometric dg categories and categorical measures:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00620v1">Ádám Gyenge, A power structure over the Grothendieck ring of geometric dg categories</a>
      <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00620v1">Daniel Bergh, Sergey Gorchinskiy, Michael Larsen, Valery Lunts, Categorical measures for finite group actions</a>
    </ol>
    <p></p>

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01587v1">Benjamin Antieau, Jeremiah Heller, Some remarks on topological K-theory of dg categories</a> is a short preprint on topological K-theory, proving nice facts about it. It also contains the following acknowledgment:
    <blockquote>Finally, this paper would probably not be possible without the dogs Boschko and Lima, who created the opportunity for the authors to work together.</blockquote>
    <p>I'd love to know the story behind this!

  <li><p><a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sjw/pub/HH-18August2017.pdf">Sarah Witherspoon, An introduction to Hochschild cohomology</a> is a draft of a book on Hochschild cohomology. The world needed this, as is clear from <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/28472/book-on-hochschild-cohomology">this MathOverflow question</a> asking what such a book would have to contain. She focusses on Hochschild cohomology of algebras, and studies applications such as support varieties and Hopf algebras.

  <p><small>In case the link to the version of August 18 2017 ever becomes inactive, take a look at <a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sjw/bib.html">her list of publications</a>.</small>
