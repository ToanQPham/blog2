<p>There will be an <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-schools/algar-2017/">interesting summer school at the University of Antwerp, on quadratic forms and local-global principles</a>. What is relevant to know, and which is not yet on the website (but it's on the poster in our hallway so I guess the information is neither secret nor unconfirmed) is the list of speakers:
<ul>
  <li>Asher Auel (Yale)
  <li>Raman Parimala (Emory)
  <li>Suresh Venapally (Emory)
  <li>Karim Johannes Becher (University of Antwerp)
</ul>
