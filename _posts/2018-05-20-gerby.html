<p>By now it's no secret that we are working on a new version of the Stacks project website (see <a href="{% post_url 2017-08-27-introduction-gerby-plastex %}">1</a> and <a href="{% post_url 2018-01-05-introducing-gerby-tools %}">2</a>). We have been working on a system called <em>Gerby</em> for almost a year now, as a replacement for the Stacks project website. In fact, it will go live <em>tomorrow</em>.

<p>In case you are interested in knowing more about the new system, you want to run your local copy of the Stacks project website, or you are interested in testing the system for your own project, I have put up <a href="https://gerby-project.github.io/">a page describing the system</a>.

<p><small>For those of you eagerly awaiting the next fortnightly links, they will probably appear on Tuesday.
