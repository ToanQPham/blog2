  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06048">Luca Battistella, Francesca Carocci, Cristina Manolache: Virtual classes for the working mathematician</a> is a nice set of lecture notes on virtual fundamental classes.

  <li><p>It's no secret I like semiorthogonal decompositions and exceptional collections, so let me tell you about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06946">Anton Fonarev: On the bounded derived category of $\mathrm{IGr}(3,7)$</a>. It is expected that homogeneous varieties of the type $G/P$ have a full exceptional collection. Now the odd isotropic Grassmannian $\mathrm{IGr}(3,7)$ is <em>not</em> a homogeneous variety (there's a non-reductive group here), but it's sufficiently close to it that the usual methods (i.e. Borel&ndash;Weil&ndash;Bott for the ordinary Grassmannian) can be applied to it, as it is the zero section of a vector bundle on the Grassmannian. The preprint constructs a minimal Lefschetz decomposition for the first case that was previously unknown, consisting of equivariant vector bundles.

  <li><p>Boris Shoikhet is advertising a <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/jobs/vacancies/ap/2018bapfwetef090/">PhD position at the University of Antwerp</a>.
