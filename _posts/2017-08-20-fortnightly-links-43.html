  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03409v1">Katrina Honigs, Max Lieblich, Sofia Tirabassi: Fourier-Mukai partners of Enriques and bielliptic surfaces in positive characteristic</a> is a nice and short paper which proves that there are <em>no</em> Fourier-Mukai partners for Enriques (resp. bielliptic) surfaces in characteristic at least 3 (resp. 5). The condition on the characteristic comes from the required liftability to the Witt vectors. Whether there might be Fourier-Mukai partners in small characteristic therefore remains open.

  <li><p><a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/wordpress/?p=4184">Mgbar</a> is a Stacks project blogpost concerning <a href="https://github.com/stacks/stacks-project/commit/a5d4ac0af4d867a1e232e386163b987bb2896af9">commit a5d4ac0</a>. In this commit the proof that $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_g$ is a smooth and proper Deligne-Mumford stack over $\mathop{\rm Spec}\mathbb{Z}$. This is theorem 5.2 in the <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=262240">seminal Deligne-Mumford paper on the irreducibility of $\overline{M}_g$</a>, which introduced the notion of an algebraic stack to the world (although Mumford had some preliminary work).

  <p>An interesting quote from this paper is the following:
  <blockquote>Full details on the basic properties and theorems for algebraic stacks will be given elsewhere.</blockquote>
  <p>It turns out they never gave those details themselves, but they are now (almost 50 years after they were promised) at an EGA-level of completeness in the Stacks project!
