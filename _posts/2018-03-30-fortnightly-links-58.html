<p>Now even 5 days late, but I can blame it on the conference that I was attending.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gargnano2018/courses">Lecture notes for the conference "Birational geometry of hypersurfaces"</a> contains lecture notes by Colliot-Thélène and slides by Huybrechts for their lectures in this school. The lecture notes by Colliot-Thélène are very detailed, whilst the slides by Huybrechts can always be accompanied by his lecture notes in progress for the course on cubic hypersurfaces.

  <li><p>Currently there is a <a href="https://hodge.maths.ed.ac.uk/tiki/NC+Hodge+Theory+Seminar">seminar on noncommutative Hodge theory</a> happening at the University of Edinburgh, and Brent Pym is typing up lecture notes as it progresses. Awesome!

  <li><p>I've mentioned <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/">Xena</a> before. She now has <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/009M">commented on the Stacks project website</a> (via Kevin Buzzard) highlighting a minor mistake she has found whilst formalising things from the Stacks project.
</ul>
