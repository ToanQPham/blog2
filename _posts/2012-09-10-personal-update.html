<p>Not that this blog is considered to be the medium for all my personal tidbits, but to sketch a little context for what I might be blogging about in the upcoming year I think it is appropriate to explain my current whereabouts and plans.
<p>I will be doing the <a href="http://webens-ng.math.u-psud.fr/M2/AAG/">second year of the master in mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique and Universit√© Paris-Sud XI</a>, specializing in algebraic geometry and number theory. So this means my blog might get a little more focus where mathematics is concerned. And probably I will be creating all kinds of LaTeX templates tailored to my current home universities :).
<p>The first thing I intend to blog about has nothing to do with number theory or algebraic geometry (so much for focus...) but is a follow-up on <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/some-trivia-on-derived-subgroups/" title="Some trivia on derived&nbsp;subgroups">Some trivia on derived subgroups</a>, based on a <a href="http://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/fr/page/659#militon">lecture I followed at the IHES on quasi-morphisms</a>. Just wait a little more while I type up my notes.
