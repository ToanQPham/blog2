<p>Shame on me for not posting this yesterday, but I can blame the jet lag of coming back from <a href="http://www.birs.ca/events/2016/5-day-workshops/16w5088">Banff</a> together with the last minute things for the organisation of <a href="http://antwerp-2016.ncag.info">Antwerp</a>.
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://student.ulb.ac.be/~tconnor/atlaslat/">An atlas of subgroup lattices of finite almost simple groups</a> is some fun data on the subgroup lattices of various interesting finite groups.
  <li><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3713">Kulkarni, Lieblich: Blt Azumaya algebras and moduli of maximal orders</a> is an interesting update to an earlier preprint. It describes (compactifications of) moduli of maximal orders as <em>two different</em> moduli stacks <em>with the same closed points</em>. One description is as a substack of the moduli stack of coherent algebras on the original scheme. The other description uses a nifty root stack construction to create a stack on which one can consider Azumaya algebras. Cool!
  <p><small>The main reason why Max Lieblich wanted to write this was to use the abbrevation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLT">blt</a>. He succeeded.</small>
  <li><p><a href="http://www.birs.ca/events/2016/5-day-workshops/16w5088/videos/watch/201609141033-Sierra.html">Sue Sierra, A family of quantized projective spaces</a> is one of the many exciting talks from last week's conference. What she did is turn the new and somewhat weird construction in section 3.6 of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6444">Pym's deformations of $\mathbb{P}^3$</a> into a whole family of twisted Calabi&ndash;Yau algebras, depending on an integer $n$ and a scalar $a$. She moreover explains why a certain value for $a$ is needed in Pym's setting (he works untwisted Calabi&ndash;Yau) if $n=4$, but her families exist for every value of $n$. And for $n=3$ (i.e. For a noncommutative $\mathbb{P}^2$) her construction has as underlying elliptic curve the conic and a tangent line.
  <p>If I remember correctly she also describes the point scheme for higher values of $n$. I'll leave that as an fun exercise to find out.
