<p>Reading my blog you could've figured out that we are having a <a href="http://antwerp-2016.ncag.info">big conference in Antwerp</a>. Yesterday was too hectic to liveblog this, as <a href="http://neverendingbooks.org">the neverending author</a> noticed, so I guess I'll just do one post every two days.
<h2>Monday September 19</h2>
<p><em>Ragnar Buchweitz</em> quoted the following joke that Matt Satriano (he heard it from Dick Gross) made last week in Banff:
<blockquote>
  A good talk should contain one joke and one proof, and you should be able to tell them apart.
</blockquote>
I think Ragnar turned the punchline into <q>and they should not be the same</q>, which works equally well. Taking this advice from Ragnar (or Matt, or Dick) I might focus my discussion a little bit on the jokes the speakers made, rather than give a detailed outline of what they talked about.
<p>On a more mathematical level, he described <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0503632">Orlov's theorem</a> describing $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\operatorname{qgr}A)$ as the most important result in algebra since Hilbert's syzygy theorem.

<p><em>Michael Wemyss</em>'s joke was about surgeries on varieties:
<blockquote>
  Unfortunately, this is algebraic geometry and not topology, <em>so there are <strong>rules</strong></em>.
</blockquote>
<p>The Scottish accent in which this joke must be delivered is something you have to imagine yourself. Mathematically his talk was really cool, and you can look at his <a href="http://antwerp-2016.ncag.info/wemyss.pdf">very pretty slides</a> yourself.

<p><em>Goncalo Tabuada</em> give a really nice talk about <a href="{% post_url 2013-11-14-possible-noncommutative-progress-on-the-standard-conjectures %}">some work I talked about earlier on my blog</a>. Using the equivalence of various of the standard conjectures with their noncommutative analogues, it becomes possible to prove them for various high-dimensional varieties using results from low-dimensional varieties as long as they are related via homological projective duality. Cool!

<h2>Tuesday September 20</h2>
<p><em>Alexander Polishchuk</em> defined the Hochschild cochain complex and decided to use the notation $\mathrm{CH}$ for it, admitting that it might be confused with the Chow group, only to start referring to it that way afterwards on a few occasions! Besides screwing with the audience's mind in this way, he gave a very nice talk on moduli of $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-structures, exhibiting isomorphisms with other moduli spaces in various examples.

<p><em>Tobias Dyckerhoff</em> gave an intriguing and seemingly far-reaching categorification result, that was later used by Kapranov in his talk. Tobias talked about Dold&ndash;Kan correspondence, and used the letters A and B to denote objects on respective sides of the correspondence, which led Alexander Kuznetsov to point out that he was actually talking about the A- and B-side in mirror symmetry. Tobias remarked that he didn't know how far that thought would actually bring you.

<p>Another cool talk from today was by <em>Henning Krause</em>. I learned that the stable module category and the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a (non-constant) finite group scheme does not have Serre duality, but he fixed this by showing it has <em>local Serre duality</em>, i.e. that a certain subquotient associated to a homogeneous prime ideal of the Ext-algebra has Serre duality. I should probably figure out a bit more about non-semisimple cocommutative Hopf algebras to really understand to which kind of examples this applies.
<p>He started his talk with a modification of a quote by Emmy Noether in his ICM address from 1932, which went like
<blockquote>Über die Bedeuting des Kommutative für des Nichtkommutative.</blockquote>
<p>meaning that he wanted to discuss the meaning of commutative ideas to the noncommutative world (Noether said it in the opposite way). Maybe I'll dig a little deeper into the actual context of this quote later.

<p>I'm afraid the first two afternoon talks were a bit over my head, but <em>Ed Segal</em> gave a really nice talk on homological projective duality, or rather Hori duality which is a duality predicted by physicists, and made mathematically rigorous by Jørgen Rennemo and him in a preprint called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04045">Hori-mological projective duality</a>. He admitted that the title was his idea. The mathematics in there was of the type I really like: bounded derived categories of smooth projective varieties, but in a setting out of this comfort zone because he needed Artin stacks and subcategories of their derived categories.
