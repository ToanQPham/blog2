<p>All the fuzz at the moment is about the Fields medallists, but there is one other news fact that interested me. <a href="http://www.pacm.princeton.edu/~ingrid/">Ingrid Daubechies</a>, a Belgian mathematician slash physicist was <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2010/08/19/stories/2010081966661500.htm">elected president of the International Mathematical Union</a> for the years 2011 through 2014. I hadn't read anything about this until this morning my eye fell on <a href="http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=3N2U9O6P">a small article in de Standaard</a>. It's always nice to see your tiny country in the news in a positive (albeit minor) way.
