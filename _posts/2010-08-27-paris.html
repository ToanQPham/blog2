<p>Apparently, Paris:
<ul>
<li>provides its inhabitants with an amazing metro network, the people using it are very polite too;
<li>is the most beige city I ever hope to see, beautiful but beige in every view;
<li>contains the wonderful <a href="http://citedelamusique.fr">Cité de la Musique</a> with the astounding <a href="http://www.citedelamusique.fr/francais/musee/presentation.aspx">Musée de la Musique</a>, I hope they will expand their collection (after the pop music extension already that's in the make) with a section devoted to tuning experiments as I'd love to see real life quarter-tone pianos <em>etc.</em> and seeing the UPIC system on which Xenakis composed Mycènes Alpha was a wonderful thing to do apart from the amazing guitar and variants thereupon collection;
<li>has other characteristics apart from the ones listed above.
</ul>
<p>Too bad <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> does not let me provide a <code>lang</code> or <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on the links.
