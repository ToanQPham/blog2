<p>The following is another music theory gem that I want to share with you: <a href="http://www2.nau.edu/tas3/wtc/">an interactive analysis of all fugues in Bach's Das Wohltemperierte Klavier</a> (both books). When I was taking a class in music analysis I was dreaming of such a thing, and it is awesome to see how it turned out in this case. So after reading <em>why</em> you need something like well (or equal) temperament as linked in the previous blogpost you can now learn about the structure of Bach's hommage to this tuning system!</p>
