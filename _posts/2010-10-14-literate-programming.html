<p>Last week I gave a talk on the history of TeX and LaTeX (more on this later) and I talked about WEB, the programming language used by Knuth in creating TeX. It follows a paradigm called <em>literate programming</em> and in my opinion it never really took a hold. But if you look at the <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/backbone.html">document source of Backbone</a> you could believe it sure has its benefits. Their <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">entire documentation</a> is beautiful by the way, if only the myriads of underdocumented C++ libraries there are out there had such nice documentation...
