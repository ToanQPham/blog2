<p>One result I really like about Brauer groups is that $latex \mathrm{Br}(\mathbb{P}_k^n)\cong\mathrm{Br}(k)$ for every possible field $latex k$. So the Azumaya algebra's on projective space are not too wild, and completely controlled by the base field.</p>
<p>Yesterday I started wondering about how this result is actually proved (my knowledge of proofs of arithmetic nature is abysmal), and what would happen for <em>twisted</em> forms of projective space, also known as Brauer-Severi varieties. This is a very silly question, in the sense that you take a representative $latex A$ of an element $latex [A]$ of the Brauer group of the base field, construct its Brauer-Severi variety $latex \mathrm{BS}(A)$, and then take its Brauer group $latex \mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{BS}(A))$. <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/xzibit-yo-dawg">It is like Xzibit became a mathematician and said something silly involving dogs and Brauer groups</a>.</p>
<h3>The Brauer group of projective space</h3>
<p>There are different ways of proving that $latex \mathrm{Br}(\mathbb{P}_k^n)=\mathrm{Br}(k)$. One can take a look at the <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/75774/brauer-group-of-projective-space">corresponding MathOverflow question</a> of <a href="http://math.dge.toyota-ct.ac.jp/uematsu/paper/Brauer_group_of_projective_spaces.pdf">these notes of Tetsuya Uematsu</a>.</p>
<p>I will sketch an approach I learnt from <a href="http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~colliot/CTnotesBrauer.pdf">Colliot-Thélène's notes</a>, which will be useful when discussing Brauer-Severi varieties. So consider the Leray spectral sequence for $latex \mathbb{P}_k^n\to\mathrm{Spec}\,k$ and the sheaf $latex \mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}$. Denote a separable closure of $latex k$ by $latex k^s$. We get a long exact sequence</p>
<p>$latex 0\to\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_k^n)\to\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n)\to\mathrm{Br}(k)\to\mathrm{Br}(\mathbb{P}_k^n)\to\mathrm{H}^1(k_{\mathrm{et}},\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n))\to\ldots$</p>
<p>where $latex \mathrm{Br}_1(\mathbb{P}_k^n)=\mathrm{ker}\left(\mathrm{Br}(\mathbb{P}_k^n)\to\mathrm{Br}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n)\right)$ is the <em>algebraic Brauer group</em>. To get the desired result we need the following facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because $latex \mathbb{P}_k^n$ has a $latex k$-rational point, the morphism $latex \mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n)\to\mathrm{Br}(k)$ is zero, because we can obtain a retract to the first inclusion.
</li>
<li>By some other method one needs to prove that $latex \mathrm{Br}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n)=0$, hence the algebraic Brauer group of projective space is equal to the whole Brauer group.
</li>
<li>To prove surjectivity, we need that $latex \mathrm{H}^1(k_{\mathrm{et}},\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n))=0$. As explained in Colliot-Thélène's notes, one can appeal to the short exact sequence of Galois modules
<p>$latex 0\to\mathrm{Pic}_{\mathbb{P}_k^n/k}^0(k^s)\to\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n)\to\mathrm{NS}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n)\to 0$</p>
<p>for this, where in our situation we have that the first term is zero, and the third term is $latex \mathbb{Z}$ with trivial action, hence we indeed get vanishing, and surjectivity.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Brauer group of Brauer-Severi varieties</h3>
<p>A first misconception that I had is that for every variety $latex X$ defined over a field $latex k$ there exists an inclusion $latex \mathrm{Br}(k)\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Br}(X)$. Such a thing needs the existence of a $latex k$-rational point, which of course is not the case for any non-trivial Brauer-Severi variety.</p>
<p>I haven't found a general statement for Brauer group of Brauer-Severi varieties, I will now discuss what I know for sure in dimension 1. But I'll pose a precise question after the sketch of the proof, which might also be a proof for the general question.</p>
<p>The following is based on section 5.0.3 in Colliot-Thélène's notes. So let $latex C/k$ be a conic, where $latex \mathrm{char}(k)\neq 2$ to be on the safe side. Writing it as $latex \mathbb{V}(x_0^2-ax_1^2-bx_2^2)$ after an appropriate change of coordinates we know that it actually is the Brauer-Severi variety for the quaternion algebra $latex (a,b)_k$.</p>
<p>In this situation we still have the vanishing of $latex \mathrm{H}^1(k_{\mathrm{et}},\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n))$, in precisely the same way.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there is no rational point (i.e. the quaternion algebra is not split), the morphism $latex \mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_k^n)\to\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}_{k^s}^n)$ turns out to have image $latex 2\mathbb{Z}$. Hence we get a short exact sequence</p>
<p>$latex 0\to\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\to\mathrm{Br}(k)\to\mathrm{Br}(C)\to 0$</p>
<p>and the non-zero element in $latex \mathrm{Br}(k)$ is precisely the quaternion algebra whose Brauer-Severi variety we are looking at. E.g. if we take the Brauer-Severi variety for the Hamilton quaternions over the field, we see that any non-split conic (they are all isomorphic anyway) over the reals has trivial Brauer group!</p>
<p>Based on this proof, I have the following question.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Question</strong> Is the Brauer group of a Brauer-Severi variety of a central simple algebra always the Brauer group of the base field modulo the subgroup generated by the central simple algebra?
</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that the proof outlined above should give precisely this result. Am I overlooking something, or is this indeed the case?</p>
