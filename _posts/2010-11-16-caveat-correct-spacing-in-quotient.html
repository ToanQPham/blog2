<p>When taking a quotient with respect to a given equivalence relation, make sure to get the correct spacing. That is, <code>S/\sim</code> is not correct because <code>\sim</code> is acting like an operator here. It results in<br />
$latex S/\sim$</p>
<p>while the correct result would be<br />
$latex S/{\sim}$</p>
<p>This is easily achieved by enclosing the operator in braces, <em>i.e.</em>, just write <code>S/{\sim}</code> and all is well. This stuff can be found in the TeXbook of course, but you have to put it in practice.</p>
<p>It is remarkable how nit-picky one can get after using TeX for a while.</p>
