<p>As my previous post suggested, I was tweaking the <code>pgfplots</code> code a little, to produce a nice algebraic curve from <code>gnuplot</code> data. The current behaviour just connects all the dots in the automatically produced <code>.table</code> file. But as the calculation of an implicit function in <code>gnuplot</code> involves the creation of a surface and intersecting it with the <em>z=0</em> plane, the output is not as good as it would be in the case of a regular function.</p>
<p>But, I've hacked together a solution! Just replace the definition of <code>\pgf@readxyfile</code> by</p>
<pre><code>{% raw %}\def\pgf@readxyfile{%
  \read1 to \pgf@temp%
  \let\par=\pgf@savedpar%
  \edef\pgf@temp{\pgf@temp}%
  \ifx\pgf@temp\pgfutil@empty%
  \else\ifx\pgf@temp\pgf@partext%
    \pgfplotstreamstart%
    \pgfplotstreamend%
  \else%
    \expandafter\pgf@parsexyline\pgf@temp\pgf@stop%
  \fi\fi%
  \ifeof1\else\expandafter\pgf@readxyfile\fi%
}{% endraw %}</code></pre>
<p>It actually went quite smooth, it took me less than an hour to start reading the source (after a tip on <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com">tex.stackexchange.com</a>) to find the solution, write an answer for my topic and write two blog posts about it.</p>
<p>By the way, the code to produce the plot is</p>
<pre><code>\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=1,yscale=.25]
  \draw plot[id=curve, raw gnuplot, smooth] function{
    f(x,y) = y**2 + (x**2 - 5)*(4*x**4 - 20*x**2 + 25);
    set xrange [-4:4];
    set yrange [-15:15];
    set view 0,0;
    set isosample 1000,1000;
    set table;
    set size square;
    set cont base;
    set cntrparam levels incre 0,0.1,0;
    unset surface;
    splot f(x,y)
  };
\end{tikzpicture}</code></pre>
<p>So in case you've always wondered how to draw algebraic curves or implicit functions in LaTeX, this is my hackish solution! Any comments on this?</p>
