  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05660">Dmitri Kaledin, Witt vectors, commutative and noncommutative</a> is a pretty preprint on (you'd never guess) Witt vectors. Its introduction is a really nice overview of the history of the subject, and explains in a nice way the interesting role that Witt vectors play in mathematics. The goal of the preprint is to describe Hochschild&ndash;Witt homology and discuss some of its (conjectured) properties.

  <li><p><a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~danhl/derived_equivalences_2016_09_18.pdf">Daniel Halpern-Leistner, The D-equivalence conjecture for moduli spaces of sheaves</a> is a note explaining a proof of the Bondal&ndash;Orlov conjecture in high dimension for a specific type of Calabi&ndash;Yau manifolds, namely those which are birational to a moduli space of (Gieseker semistable) coherent sheaves on a K3 surface. Recall that they conjectured that projective birational Calabi&ndash;Yau's are automatically derived equivalent, a result which is known in dimension&nbsp;3. So if your favourite Calabi&ndash;Yau varieties look like the $\mathop{\rm Hilb}^n X$ of a K3 surface $X$, you can now apply wall-crossing and get your desired derived equivalences!

  <li><p>Finally, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B08cFX--ntkpTDdvUWY2M0ZRSDQ/view">Pavel Etingof, A counterexample to the Poincar&eacute;&ndash;Birkhoff&ndash;Witt theorem</a> is a slightly provocative abstract for a talk, but he quickly explains how it's not a counterexample to the PBW as you know it, but an analogue for general symmetric tensor categories, and in this case it fails for the Verlinde category.
