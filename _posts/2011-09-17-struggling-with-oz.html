<p>For those who have been waiting eagerly for more news on my computational composition project: I have rushed it a little. I should've spent more time familiarizing myself with the Oz programming language, some of the concepts are fundamentally different from the paradigms I've learnt so far. And then my summer job as a postman was a bit more time-consuming than it was in previous years.</p>
<p>But now I'll try to make up for my hybris, learn Oz (and Strasheela) thoroughly and continue the project. I am considering a post (or several) discussing the peculiarities from the perspective of a generic computer science student who doesn't know anything about exotic paradigms but is rather fluent in C++. This "learning by blogging" approach is quite popular on math blogs, so maybe I should check it out :).</p>
