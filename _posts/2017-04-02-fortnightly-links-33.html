  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08782">Claus Ringel, Quiver Grassmannians for wild acyclic quivers</a> is an extension of the result that any projective variety can be realised as a quiver Grassmannian, showing that <em>any</em> wild acyclic quiver can be used (previous results by Zimmerman-Huisgen, Hille, and Reineke used a specific quiver). I have <a href="{% post_url 2013-05-24-every-projective-variety-is-a-quiver-grassmannian-the-algorithm %}">previously blogged</a> about a silly implementation that performs these steps in the case of Reineke's construction, in case you want to see how it goes in detail.

  <li><p>Some excellent news: <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/arxivpub/2017/02/10/arXiv%27s+TeX+processing+system+receives+significant+upgrade">arXiv's TeX processing system receives significant upgrade</a>.

  <li><p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0393044017300311">Narasimhan, Derived categories of moduli spaces of vector bundles on curves</a> is a paper that I've been wanting to see for a while. It is shows that $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(C)$ (where $C$ is any smooth projective curve of genus $g\geq 3$) can be embedded in the derived category of the moduli space of rank&ndash;2 vector bundles with fixed determinant of degree&ndash;1 (which is a Fano variety). I have previously mentioned the completely different <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02241v1">Kuznetsov&ndash;Fonarev</a> preprint proving the same result for a generic curve. Narasimhan's paper was earlier but not available as a preprint, and proves the result for all curves using vanishing results (which admittedly are a bit outside my comfort zone).

<p><small>There seems to have been an issue, preventing this blogpost from being published on Sunday last week. Hopefully it appears now.
