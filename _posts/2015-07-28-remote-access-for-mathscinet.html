<p>Have you ever encountered the username and password dialog box for MathSciNet whilst accessing it from your home connection? Of course, you could VPN to your institution to gain access, but it is now possible to sidestep this! I was told about this new functionality by Edward Dunne at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/2015summerinstitute/">AMS Summer Institute in Algebraic Geometry</a>, that allows you to use client-side storage to authenticate you for 90 days (it can be renewed after that), even if you are not using your institution's connection! The relevant pages are:</p>
