<p>Robert Thomason suggests the following in his article The classification of triangulated subcategories:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reader may find the indirectness of the proof of this useful corollary psychologically uncomfortable. If so, rather than dosing himself with a benzodiazepine, he may find relief in deducing Corollary 2.3 from the following criterion for equality of two classes in $\mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{D})$, whose proof is very similar to that of Lemma 2.2. [...]</p></blockquote>
<p>I never checked whether we have diazepines next to the pens in the office supplies closet in the department.</p>
