<p>Time for an update on <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/">ANAGRAMS</a>, our student seminar at the University of Antwerp. The first two weeks of February we had short talks on <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/dimension-functions.html">dimension functions</a>. See the web page for some of the notes people had prepared. I gave a lecture about <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/dimension-functions/depth.pdf">depth and singularities</a>.</p>
<p>The next topic is <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/git.html">geometric invariant theory</a>, we will dedicate 6 lectures for it. The schedule is not completely fixed yet, but we will start Friday, at 10 o'clock. Feel free to attend.</p>
<p>Per <a href="http://preschema.com">Adeel</a>'s request I have also created a <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/">personal webpage</a>. It's rather ironic that his excellent webpage seems to be down, I hope I can update this post soon to announce it's up again.</p>
