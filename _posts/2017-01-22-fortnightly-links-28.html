<p><small>In case you are wondering why there's only fortnightly links lately, and not any other blogposts: I'm in full PhD thesis writing mode.</small>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to learn about Fulton's trace formula, there's Lenny Taelman's <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/l.d.j.taelman/beijing.pdf">Sheaves and functions modulo $p$</a> (also <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/sheaves-and-functions-modulo-ipi/02F268A6136DF8AE9EA319EA24C98636">published</a>), and Daniel Litt's <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57bf2a6de3df281593b7f57d/t/57bf68906a49636398ee2c61/1472161936887/fultontrace.pdf">short overview</a>.

  <li><a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/schroer/fd-atlas.html">FD-Atlas</a> is a collection of classes of finite-dimensional algebras, managed by Jan Schroër. I like canonical algebras, and more generally directed algebras, I guess because I'm actually an algebraic geometer that likes exceptional collections. Which one is your favourite?

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00455">Toën&ndash;Vezzosi, Géométrie non-commutative, formule des traces et conducteur de Bloch</a> is a summary about the proposed proof of Bloch's conductor formula, using noncommutative and derived algebraic geometry. I think this is one of the most exciting things to happen in my area interest, which explains why I've previously blogged about this (<a href="{% post_url 2016-07-23-fortnightly-links-15 %}">1</a>, <a href="{% post_url 2016-09-22-liveblogging-the-antwerp-conference-2 %}">2</a>). I wouldn't have mentioned it again, but it will also be the subject of Bertrand's lecture series at the <a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/events/eventpages/hausdorff-school/wwwhcmuni-bonndehsfasim0/ncg-2017/">Hausdorff School on derived noncommutative geometry</a>.
</ul>
