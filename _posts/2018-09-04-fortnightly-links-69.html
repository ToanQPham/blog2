<p>Because of my holiday the schedule has been shifted by a week, and the post is 2 days late.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0EUE">The spectrum of the integers is not quasi-compact</a> is the title of a <a href="https://github.com/stacks/stacks-project/commit/20dfbcb53b6965cd8360e49e93fdc05480440a4f">newly added</a> example in the Stacks project. It sounds of course ridiculous to claim that $\mathop{\mathrm{Spec}}\mathbb{Z}$ is not quasicompact. But this is for the canonical topology on the category of schemes, which is of course much finer than the Zariski topology!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03678v1">Srikanth Iyengar, Ryo Takahashi, Openness of the regular locus and generators for module categories</a> is a nice and short paper which relates the regularity properties of (quotients of) a noetherian ring $R$ to the existence of (classical) generators in the bounded derived category (resp. singularity category) of $R$. This can be compared to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04484">Neeman's results</a> on the existence of <em>strong</em> generators, as is also done in remark 2.12 of their paper.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09727">Janko Boehm, Wolfram Decker, Anne Frühbis-Krüger, Franz-Josef Pfreundt, Mirko Rahn, Lukas Ristau, Towards massively parallel computations in algebraic geometry</a> discusses one of the first steps in parallelizing computations in algebraic geometry. This is a really exciting evolution. If the authors read this, they could take up <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06333">Borisov and Keum's Explicit equations of a fake projective plane</a> as another example of a surface of general type with explicit but very complicated equations.
</ul>
