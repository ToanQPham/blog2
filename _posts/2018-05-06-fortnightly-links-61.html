  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00590">Minseon Shin: The cohomological Brauer group of a torsion $\mathbb{G}_{\mathfrak{m}}$-gerbe</a> is a fun preprint explaining how the Brauer&ndash;Severi scheme of a Brauer class behaves in the same way as the $\mathbb{G}_{\mathfrak{m}}$-gerbe associated to this class. Indeed, for $\alpha\in\operatorname{Br}'(X)$ it is a classical fact due to Gabber that $\operatorname{Br}'(\operatorname{BS}(\alpha))$ is the quotient of $\operatorname{Br}'(X)$ by the class $\alpha$, and it turns out that the same is true for $\operatorname{Br}'(\mathcal{X})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the $\mathbb{G}_{\mathfrak{m}}$-gerbe over $X$ associated to $\alpha$.

  <li><p><a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/rrage">RRAGE: Ragnar's ramifications in algebra and geometry emerging workshop</a> is a workshop dedicated to the work of Ragnar Buchweitz. I don't often announce conferences on my blog (see <a href="http://ncag.info">ncag.info</a> for this), but for Ragnar I am making an exception.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00294">George Dimitrov, Ludmil Katzarkov: Non-commutative curve-counting invariants</a> introduces the idea of counting Kronecker quivers inside triangulated categories. It turns out that this can shed light on the <em>Markov conjecture</em> (stated by Frobenius actually, in 1913), which says that an integer solution $(a,b,c)$ with $a<b<c$ to Markov's equation (first studied in 1879)
  \begin{equation}
    x^3+y^3+z^3=3xyz
  \end{equaton}
  is uniquely determined by $c$. Indeed, because exceptional collections in $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ are extremely well-understood, if a Kronecker quiver gets embedded in this triangulated category, there is a well-defined vector bundle in the orthogonal complement, and one can understand the Markov conjecture in terms of this vector bundle. The authors then say that they want to study the symplectic geometry of the mirror of $\mathbb{P}^2$. If this approach works out, that would be an awesome application of mirror symmetry.
