<p>See <a href="http://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/announcing-a-seminar/">Announcing a seminar</a> for a little context.
<p>The past four weeks I've given lectures on Grothendieck duality for the ANAGRAMS seminar (yes, this is a redundancy). The goal was to tell people something about Riemann-Roch and Serre duality first, then go on to Grothendieck duality and discuss some of the proofs. I changed the schedule a little while I was giving the lectures (originally I planned more on Grothendieck duality, but the down-to-earth geometric applications were more appropriate for the audience, I think). I have prepared notes for each of these lectures, which are now available at the <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/grothendieck-duality.html">seminar webpage</a>.
<p>Maybe I will rewrite some things for my weblog, if people want me to elaborate on certain aspects.
<p><small>And in the philosophy of open research, there is the <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/ANAGRAMS-grothendieck-duality">Git repository for the notes</a>. Feel free to contribute!</small>
