  <li><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/supersymmetry-delignes-theorem/">Urs Schreiber, Why supersymmetry?</a> describes what Deligne's work on Tannakian has to do with elementary particles. The crux of the story is that elementary particles seem to behave a lot like tensor categories, the main example of which is the category of representations of a group. Then the question is how to describe any such tensor category as something coming from a group, and it turns out that it is enough to use supergroups for this, i.e. you sprinkle some $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-grading everywhere. The question of course is whether you do need funny stuff in odd degree to describe physics.

  <li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06746">Degtyarev, Smooth models of singular K3 surfaces</a> is a fun paper regarding the Fermat quartic $x^4+y^4+z^4+w^4=0$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$, which is a (smooth) K3 surface. It is classical that in this case there are 48 lines on the K3 surface (the number 48 comes from 3 partitions of the four coordinates in 2 sets of 2, and then 16 choices of 4th roots of unity). In the paper is shown that it can be embedded into $\mathbb{P}^3$ in two other essentially different ways, and that in these embeddings there are 56 lines!

  <li><a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~kowalski/deligne.pdf">Emannuel Kowalski, Trying to understand Delign's proof of the Weil conjectures</a> is an absolutely brilliant exposition on the Weil conjectures, why Ã©tale cohomology is what it is, and how Lefschetz pencils are used to reduce the proof.

  <li><a href="https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/">Weapons of Math Destruction</a> is the brand new book of <a href="http://mathbabe.org">Cathy O'Neil</a>. The <a href="https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/about/">various reviews</a> I've read (of course, there might be a small selection bias at work here) are very positive, and I'm looking forward to read the actual book. Based on the descriptions I think it might be the case that people who like John Oliver's <a href="http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver">Last Week Tonight</a> will like the book, or vice versa.
