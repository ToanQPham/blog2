<p>Not that I'm intending to blog regularly, but at least there is a completely set-up space to do so in case the urge kicks in. When the actual bloggingÂ <em>will</em> start, it will be featuring stuff on (computational or algorithmic) composition and ramblings on both computer science and mathematics.
<p>For now, please enjoy yourself reading something more interesting. I'd suggest <em>Pafko at the Wall</em> from Don DeLillo.
