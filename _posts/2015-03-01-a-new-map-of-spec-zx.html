<p>A little over <a href="https://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/an-atlas-of-the-affine-line-over-the-integer/">two years ago</a> I started my Atlas of $\mathop{\mathrm{Spec}}\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Today I <a href="https://pbelmans.wordpress.com/atlas/#mumford-2015">added another map</a>, from a (forever draft?) book of David Mumford and Tadao Oda.
<p>I urge you to check out the website of David Mumford, who, despite having switched from algebraic geometry to vision in the 80s maintains an <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/alg_geom/introAG.html">excellent overview of all his work in geometry</a>. In particular, he recently posted this draft version of a book which is over 40 years old, which contains a TeX'ified version of his map of the affine line over the integers on page 120.
