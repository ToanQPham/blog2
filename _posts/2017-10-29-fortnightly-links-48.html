  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05902v1">Bertrand ToÃ«n, Gabriele Vezzosi: Trace formula for dg-categories and Bloch's conductor conjecture I</a> is the preprint proving Bloch's conductor formula using techniques from derived and noncommutative algebraic geometry. I've blogged about this result on several occasions, as I think it's one of the more exciting applications of abstract machinery to very down-to-earth questions.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09045">Akhil Mathew, Kaledin's degeneration theorem and topological Hochschild homology</a> is another amazing preprint in derived and noncommutative algebraic geometry. It reproves Kaledin's degeneration in a very clean way using the machinery of topological Hochschild and cyclic homology. Cool!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06039">Benjamin Antieau, Gabriele Vezzosi: A remark on the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg theorem in characteristic $p$</a> is a fun paper about one of my favourite results: the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition of Hochschild (co)homology. In this preprint, the authors apply a cute duality result to improve $\operatorname{dim}X&lt;p$ to $\operatorname{dim}X\leq p$. What is a funny coincidence is that this method was (first?) applied in the Deligne&ndash;Illusie paper proving degeneration of the Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence, and it's its noncommutative analogue (the Hochschild-to-cyclic spectral sequence) which is the subject of Kaledin's degeneration result.
