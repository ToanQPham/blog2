<p>Next summer sometime in July or August <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/">Johan de Jong</a>, <a href="http://math.lsa.umich.edu/~weiho/">Wei Ho</a>, and I will organise a workshop on algebraic geometry and the Stacks project. Please go to the <a href="https://stacks.github.io/">workshop webpage</a> for more information (not a lot there yet) and to pre-register.

<p>See also <a href="http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong/wordpress/?p=4143">Johan's announcement</a>, which is exactly the same as this except for a permutation of the organisers.
