<p>Given that I was on a holiday 2 weeks ago, you get a double fortnightly links today.
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09952">John Christian Ottem, JÃ¸rgen Vold Rennemo: A counterexample to the birational Torelli problem for Calabi&ndash;Yau 3-folds</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00534">Lev Borisov, Andrei Caldararu, Alex Perry: Intersections of two Grassmannians in $\mathbb{P}^9$</a> are two interesting preprints, showing that there exist deformation equivalent and derived equivalent Calabi&ndash;Yau 3-folds, which are not birational. This is a counterexample to "birational Torelli", because derived equivalent Calabi&ndash;Yau 3-folds have equivalent middle Hodge cohomology structure, and it is precisely this structure which one would use to describe a Torelli-like theorem.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06035">Brent Pym, Travis Schedler: Holonomic Poisson manifolds and deformations of elliptic algebras</a> is a preprint defining a very well-behaved class of Poisson manifolds, whose deformation theory is especially nice. It turns out that the Feigin&ndash;Odesskii Poisson structures on $\mathbb{P}^n$ are of this type, which sheds new light on the behavior of Sklyanin algebras.

  <li><a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/7426">Recordings of the Arbeitstagung 2017 on "Physical Mathematics" in honor of Yuri Manin</a>, but I haven't been able yet to watch any of them so I can't give highlights.
