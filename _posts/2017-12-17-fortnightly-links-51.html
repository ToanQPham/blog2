  <li><a href="https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/polynomial-roots-toy/">Complex polynomial roots toy</a> is a fun interactive tool by Leo Stein to see how changing the coefficients of a polynomial changes the location of its roots, and vice versa.

  <li>My friend <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~jvonk/">Jan Vonk</a> and his co-authors have recently been <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-crack-the-cursed-curve-20171207/">featured in Quanta</a> for their preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05846">Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the split Cartan modular curve of level 13</a> (or more click-baity <em>Are there are more than 7 points on the cursed curve</em>?)

  <li>The advanced search at arXiv can tell you which ICM reports have already been uploaded for next year's ICM. The following is a list of reports which I find interesting (and therefore might be interesting to the reader of this blog)
