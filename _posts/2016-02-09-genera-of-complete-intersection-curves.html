<p>During the Christmas break I had a little fun with my series of algebraic geometry fun facts. One of these was a <a href="https://pbelmans.wordpress.com/2015/12/27/algebraic-geometry-fun-facts-for-the-festivities-genera-of-complete-intersection-curves/">description of the genera of complete intersection curves</a>, the upshot being that there are genera for which there is not a single complete intersection curve with that genus.</p>
<p>A while ago I submitted this sequence to the OEIS, and now you can see <a href="https://oeis.org/A266322">all genera up to 1000</a>.</p>
