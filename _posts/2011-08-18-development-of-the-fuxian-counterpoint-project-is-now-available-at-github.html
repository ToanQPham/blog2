<p>In case you wish to follow my progress with Strasheela and implementing Fuxian counterpoint in it, there is one place to go: <a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/FuxianCounterpoint">github.com/pbelmans/FuxianCounterpoint</a>. For the moment it is only capable of:
<ul>
<li>staying in the correct scale;
<li>choosing intervals from a given list (but unlike the example from Strasheela, <em>it is capable of distinguishing between ascending and descending intervals</em>!);
<li>doing this for first-species counterpoint in two voices.
</ul>
<p>Of course, I am greatly indebted to <code>$STRASHEELA/examples/Counterpoint-Examples/Fuxian-Counterpoint-with-Scale.oz</code>. And that implementation is far more capable than mine at the moment, but hey, it's a work in progress :).
<p>What I would like to do next is:
<ul>
<li>produce a write-up on the melodic rules I intend to use (i.e., translate my course notes and elaborate a little bit);
<li>implement the strict rules;
<li>find a way to iterate over multiple solutions and assign scores to them (based on guidelines like: mostly small melodic steps, don't stick to a small range, ...);
<li>if the preceding point is either a bad idea or computationally / technically infeasible, find a better approach.
</ul>
<p>Generalizing to other species and more voices is something I plan to do later. As for now, this post was mostly an announcement of the GitHub repository.
