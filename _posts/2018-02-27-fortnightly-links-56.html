<p>2 days late, but jet lag and work on the new Stacks project website is to be blamed for that. More on that later this week.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03762v1">Alexander Kuznetsov, Embedding derived category of an Enriques surface into derived category of a Fano variety</a> is a really cute result: certain Enriques surfaces can be embedded into the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$, which is a Fano 4-fold, and blowing up the surface <strong>preserves</strong> the ampleness of the anticanonical bundle! So that means you've embedded the derived category of the Enriques surface into the derived category of a Fano 4-fold, which moreover has its Hodge numbers concentrated on the diagonal. For a general Enriques surface a similar construction with a Fano 6-fold can be done.
  <p>Can something similar be done for a fake projective plane?

  <li><p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13373-018-0119-z">Dmitri Kaledin, How to glue derived categories</a> is an expository long article (almost book-length) about enhancements of triangulated categories, with a view towards gluing questions. It was also the topic of his talk at the <a href="http://antwerp-2016.ncag.info">Antwerp conference</a> 2 years ago.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06023">S. Paul Smith: Simple modules over the 4-dimensional Sklyanin Algebras at points of finite order</a> is a preprint which was written in 1993 but never published, on 4-dimensional Sklyanin algebras associated to translations of finite orders. Such algebras are necessarily finite over their center, and they have an interesting fat point geometry.

  <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06487">Chelsea Walton, Xingting Wang, Milen Yakimov: Poisson geometry and representations of PI 4-dimensional Sklyanin algebras</a> the Poisson geometry of these algebras is studied, which is closely related to their fat point geometry (which Smith studied using algebro-geometric techniques, avoiding all representation theory). It should be remarked that they discuss some issues with the 1993 preprint, e.g. in remark 2.13.
