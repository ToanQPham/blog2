<p>It seems like I missed the exciting preprints and links these past 2 weeks, because I only have 1 fortnightly link.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://math.rice.edu/~jrc9/stuff/math566.pdf">John Calabrese, Math 566</a> are lecture notes, intended to cover some of the basic necessities for understanding Huybrechts' awesome book on Fourier&ndash;Mukai transforms, and then discuss selected topics from it.
</ul>
