<p>I ran into the following lovely quote by the late Andrei Tyurin:
<blockquote><p>An algebraic geometer is skillful enough if he or she can recognize the geometric person under many guises of different dimensions.</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this quote (and the quote itself) can be read in his <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1483334">1995 lecture notes for the summer school on algebraic geometry in Ankara</a>. One of the examples that a skilful algebraic geometer must know are the objects:
<ul>
<li>in dimension 0: 6 distinct points on the projective line up to projective equivalence

<li>in dimension 1: a genus 2 curve

<li>in dimension 2: a cubic surface with a unique ordinary double point

<li>in dimension 3: a nonsingular intersection of 2 quadric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^5$

</ul>
<p>and more importantly their relation to each other:
<ul>
<li>the genus 2 curve is a double cover of the projective line ramified in 6 distinct points

<li>blowing up 6 points on a conic (so the points are not in general position!) in $\mathbb{P}^2$ gives a singular cubic surface

<li>the pencil spanned by the two quadric hypersurfaces has 6 singular members

</ul>
<p>Recently, many developments in the study of derived categories of smooth projective varieties have been of this nature too, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507292">Kuznetsov's homological projective duality</a>, or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6829">Segal--Thomas example of a Calabi&ndash;Yau threefold embedding in a Fano elevenfold</a>. In noncommutative algebraic geometry there is also the intricate connection between noncommutative planes and planar cubic curves which comes to mind.
<p><small>He uses the word <em>person</em> at another point in the text where I would say <em>object</em>. I don't know whether he has his own idiosyncratic vocabulary just like Erd≈ës did.</small>
