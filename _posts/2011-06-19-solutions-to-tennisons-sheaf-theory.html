<p>For my reading course on Sheaf theory I had the luminous idea to solve all exercises in Tennison's Sheaf theory. As the semester neared its end and my time grew short, I couldn't solve <em>all</em> the exercises, yet the first half of the book is more or less solved. The apparent steep increase in difficulty might've played a role too. The answers I have supplied might be a little shabby at times, but that's exactly why I decided to be this rigorous in my approach by TeX'ing it all: before this exercise spree my answers would've been even more cranky...</p>
<p>Of course there could be mistakes in it and some arguments are on the intuitive side. But overall I'm satisfied with it, I learned a lot of sheaf theory and category theory doing this. Wednesday's my final on it, after which I'll say goodbye to my fellow green Sheaf theory book (the library bound it in a green hardcover used for the entire LMSL series) I carried around all semester :). Next is <a href="http://math216.wordpress.com/">Math 216: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, in case you might need it, here they are: <a href="http://pbelmans.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/exercises.pdf">Solutions to some of the exercises from Tennisonâ€™s Sheaf Theory</a>. In case you feel like extending / improving the answers, it's on github: <a href="http://github.com/pbelmans/sheaf-theory">pbelmans/sheaf-theory</a>. Maybe I'll do so in the summer, but for a 3 ECTS course it's been enough for now.</p>
