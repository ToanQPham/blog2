<p>To make sense of the next post, and potentially attract more attendees, I want to announce a student seminar on algebra and algebraic geometry at the University of Antwerp. It's called <a href="http://win.ua.ac.be/~pbelmans/seminar/">ANAGRAMS</a>, which is an acronym for "Antwerp algebraic geometry, rings and more seminar".
<p>All the interesting information can be found on the website, to summarise: PhD students give lectures for PhD students on subjects related to algebraic geometry and algebra (based on the research areas we are active in). We pick a subject, work on it for a few weeks, then take another one. It's about learning things, it's not a research seminar.
<p>If you want to know anything, just contact me. I guess the number of potential attendees who are also readers of my blog is rather small (I don't want to know the limiting factor lest it be the number of readers...), but please prove me wrong!
