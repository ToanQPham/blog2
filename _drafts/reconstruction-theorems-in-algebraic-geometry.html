<p>One question that is asked in algebraic geometry is</p>
<blockquote><p>What geometric information can we obtain from a category $latex \mathcal{C}_X$ associated to the scheme $latex X$?</p></blockquote>
<p>Possible choices for the category $latex \mathcal{C}_X$ in the question are</p>
<ul>
<li>the category of coherent sheaves $latex \mathrm{coh}(X)$</li>
<li>the category of quasicoherent sheaves $latex \mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$</li>
<li>the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $latex \mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathrm{coh}(X))$</li>
<li>the derived category of quasicoherent sheaves $latex \mathbf{D}(\mathrm{Qcoh}(X))$</li>
<li>the subcategory of perfect complexes $latex \mathrm{Perf}(X)$</li>
</ul>
<p>The question as stated originally is really broad, and in this post we will consider a specific instance of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let $latex X$ and $latex Y$ be sufficiently schemes. Which conditions do we need to obtain that $latex X$ and $latex Y$ are isomorphic, given that $latex \mathcal{C}_X$ and $latex \mathcal{C}_Y$ are equivalent?</p></blockquote>
<p>We will see that the type of equivalence in this question is important: we could ask this equivalence to be compatible with some extra structure on the category $latex \mathcal{C}_X$. These extra structures could be an abelian structure, a triangulated structure, a monoidal structure, a combination of both, ... The interplay of these choices will actually be really interesting!</p>
<p>The goal of this post is mainly to get some of the facts straight, and provide a short overview of the results. And it motivates one of the guiding principles in noncommutative algebraic geometry, originally due to Grothendieck:</p>
<blockquote><p>To do geometry one does not need the space itself but only the category of sheaves on that would-be space.</p></blockquote>
<p><small>By the way, if anyone can give me the exact location of this quote, or even the location of its attribution to Grothendieck by Manin, please tell me.</small></p>
<h2>The reconstruction theorems</h2>
<h3>Gabriel's reconstruction theorem</h3>
<p>The original reconstruction theorem goes back to the early sixties: in the <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item?id=BSMF_1962__90__323_0">PhD thesis by Pierre Gabriel</a> it is proved in section VI.3 that if $latex X$ and $latex Y$ are noetherian schemes and $latex \mathrm{coh}(X)$ and $latex \mathrm{coh}(Y)$ are equivalent as <em>abelian</em> categories, then $latex X$ and $latex Y$ are isomorphic. So in this case we use the abelian structure of the category.</p>
