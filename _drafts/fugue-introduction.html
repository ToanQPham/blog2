<p>This year I am both finishing my PhD, and finishing my music theory class. I've been studying harmony, counterpoint and composition for a while now, and it's coming together now in writing a project about the fugue versus the classical guitar.
<p>There are several things I intend to write about:
<ul>
  <li>give an introduction to the fugue as a form, using examples from the literature for guitar;
  <li>compare the literature for guitar (including transcriptions from cello and violin) to the literature for piano and organ;
  <li>analyse various interesting examples, showcasing the specifics of fugues written for guitar.
</ul>
<p>This weblog used to be called <em>On music, computing and math</em>, and because of this I will be translating some of the more interesting parts whilst I'm writing the actual project in Dutch.

<p>You can find the entire series under the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/tags#fugue">tag 'fugue'</a>.
