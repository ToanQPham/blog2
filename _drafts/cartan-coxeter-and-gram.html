<p>If you have a (numerical) Grothendieck group, it comes equipped with an Euler form and usually it has a Serre automorphism too. If the numerical Grothendieck group happens to be finitely generated (i.e. isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for some $n$), then choosing a basis you can express the Euler form (which is a bilinear form) and the Serre automorphism as a matrix in terms of this basis. In that case the terminology that is used in the literature is:
<dl>
  <dt>Euler form $\langle-,-\rangle$
  <dd><em>Gram matrix</em>
  <dd><em>Cartan matrix</em>

  <dt>Serre automorphism $\mathbb{S}$
  <dd><em>Coxeter matrix</em>
</dl>
<p>The Serre automorphism is sometimes called <em>Coxeter transformation</em> too.

<p>If we denote the Cartan&ndash;Gram matrix for the Euler form by $A$ and the Coxeter matrix for the Serre automorphism by $C$, then there is a strong relationship between the two.

<p><strong>Proposition</strong> We have that
$$
C=-A^{-1}A^{\mathrm{t}}.
$$
<p><em>Proof.</em> Because $\langle-,-\rangle$ is nondegenerate, we have $\det A\neq 0$, and
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \langle y,x\rangle
  &=y^{\mathrm{t}}Ax \\
  &=x^{\mathrm{t}}A^{\mathrm{t}}y \\
  &=-x^{\mathrm{t}}A(-A^{-1}A^{\mathrm{t}})y \\
  &=\left\langle x,(-A^{-1}A^{\mathrm{t}})y \right\rangle
\end{aligned}
$$
so we get the desired relationship by nondegeneracy. $\blacksquare$

<p>To finish this blogpost, let's give the two easiest examples: curves and quivers.
<p><strong>Example 1</strong> The numerical Grothendieck group of a smooth projective curve $C$ is generated by $[k(p)]$ and $\mathcal{O}_C$. You can easily compute using Riemann&ndash;Roch that
$$
A=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & -1 \\
  1 & 1-g
\end{pmatrix}
$$
and
$$
C=
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 2g-2 \\
  0 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
$$
where $g$ is the genus of the curve.

<p><strong>Example 2</strong> The (numerical) Grothendieck group of a path algebra for an acyclic quiver has two obvious choices of basis: the simples, and the projectives. There is also a strong connection between the Serre functor and Auslander&ndash;Reiten triangles, see e.g. theorem A of <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1887637">Reiten&ndash;Van den Bergh, Noetherian hereditary abelian categories</a>.
<p>If we take the Dynkin quiver $\mathrm{D}_4$ as an example, and we orient the arrows from left to right, then
$$
A=
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
and
$$
C=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  -1 & -1 & -1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
