<p>Reading my blog you could've figured out that we are having a <a href="http://antwerp-2016.ncag.info">big conference in Antwerp</a>. Yesterday was too hectic to liveblog this, as <a href="http://neverendingbooks.org">the neverending author</a> noticed, so I guess I'll just do one post every two days.
<h2>Monday September 19</h2>
<p><em>Ragnar Buchweitz</em> quoted the following joke that Matt Satriano made last week in Banff:
<blockquote>
  A good talk should contain one joke and one proof, and you should be able to tell them apart.
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I forgot who Matt attributed it to, I'll ask him. I think Ragnar turned the punchline into <q>and they should not be the same</q>, which works equally well.
<p>On a more mathematical level, he describes Orlov's theorem as the most important result in algebra since Hilbert's syzygy theorem.

<p><em>Michael Wemyss</em>'s joke was about surgeries on varieties:
<blockquote>
  Unfortunately, this is algebraic geometry and not topology, <em>so there are <strong>rules</strong></em>.
</blockquote>
<p>The Scottish accent in which this joke must be delivered is something you have to imagine yourself.
