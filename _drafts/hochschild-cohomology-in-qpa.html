<p>Every once in a while I want to compute the Hochschild cohomology of a finite-dimensional algebra which is given as a quiver with relations. Luckily, provided the quiver isn't too big, this can be done quite easily using <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/qpa">QPA</a> which is a package for <a href="https://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a>.

<p>As an example to see how this is done, let us consider the Beilinson quiver for $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is

<p><img height="70" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/beilinson-P2.png">

<p>and the relations are $x_0y_1-y_0x_1, x_0z_1-z_0x_1, y_0z_1-z_0y_1$. Then there exists a derived equivalence $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(\mathbb{P}^2)\cong\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(kQ/I)$. There are various definitions of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathbb{P}^2$, all of them agree (luckily), and Hochschild cohomology being a derived invariant we might as well compute the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathbb{P}^2$ as the Hochschild cohomology of this finite-dimensional algebra. But if we denote $A=kQ/I$, this is nothing but $\mathrm{Ext}_{A\otimes_kA^{\mathrm{op}}}^n(A,A)$. And computing this Ext can be done in QPA. Without further ado, here is the code.

{% highlight gap %}
LoadPackage("qpa");;

Q := Quiver(["p", "q", "r"],
            [
              ["p", "q", "x0"], ["p", "q", "y0"], ["p", "q", "z0"],
              ["q", "r", "x1"], ["q", "r", "y1"], ["q", "r", "z1"]
            ]);;
kQ := PathAlgebra(Rationals, Q);;
AssignGeneratorVariables(kQ);;

relations := [x0*y1-y0*x1, x0*z1-z0*x1, y0*z1-z0*y1];;

ExtAlgebraGenerators(AlgebraAsModuleOverEnvelopingAlgebra(kQ / relations), 4);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>So all we need to know is that there exists something like <a href="https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/QPA-1.25/doc/chap8.html#X7B9209CD7A46F544"><code>ExtAlgebraGenerators</code></a> to compute the algebra structure of the Ext-algebra, and a way to get $kQ/I$ as a module over its enveloping algebra using <a href="https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/QPA-1.25/doc/chap4.html#X80D827747ACD76FA"><code>AlgebraAsModuleOverEnvelopingAlgebra</code></a>. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

<p>The output we get is
<pre>
[ [ 1, 8, 10, 0, 0 ], [ 1, 8, 0, 0, 0 ], [ [ <<[ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]> ---> <[ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>> ],
      [ <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <[ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>>, <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <
            [ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>>, <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <[ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>>,
          <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <[ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>>, <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <
            [ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>>, <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <[ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>>,
          <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <[ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>>, <<[ 0, 3, 15, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0 ]> ---> <
            [ 1, 3, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1 ]>> ], [  ], [  ], [  ] ] ]
</pre>

<p>From this we read off that $\operatorname{dim}_k\operatorname{HH}^i(kQ/I)$ is 1, 8 and 10 for $i=0,1,2$. We can also read off that as an algebra it is generated by its piece in degree 1. Then a vector space basis for this algebra is given.


<p><small>Of course, for $\mathbb{P}^2$ we could also have used the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition, expressing the Hochschild cohomology in terms of polyvector fields. But the current method allows us to compute the Hochschild cohomology of <em>noncommutative planes</em> (albeit case by case) by changing the relations in the quiver accordingly. I have written up a description of these Hochschild cohomologies in all cases of the classification using geometric techniques, which will appear on the arXiv shortly.</small>
<p><small>In another direction, I have also observed a funny numerical coincidence involving the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathbb{P}^n$, which I will also discuss soon.
