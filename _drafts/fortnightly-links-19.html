<h2>Direct summand conjecture</h2>
<p>I missed this for the previous <a href="{% post_url 2016-09-04-fortnightly-links-18 %}">fortnightly links</a>, so to make up for this I'll write a little more than usual. The <em>direct summand conjecture</em> is one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_conjectures_in_commutative_algebra">the homological conjectures in commutative algebra</a> and states the following:
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Direct summand conjecture</strong> Let $f\colon R\to S$ be a morphism of noetherian rings such that $S$ is a finite $R$-module. If $R$ is regular, then $f$ splits as map of $R$-modules.
</blockquote>
<p>This conjecture has now been proved by Yves Andr√© in his preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00345">La conjecture du facteur direct</a> using his other preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00320">Le lemme d'Abhyankar perfectoide</a>.

<p>There is also a preprint <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08882">On the direct summand conjecture and its derived variant</a> by Bhargav Bhatt which gives a shorter proof. In both cases the theory of perfectoid spaces is used, and unfortunately I cannot comment much on this. The derived invariant in Bhatt's title refers to a conjecture suggested by de Jong
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Derived direct summand conjecture</strong> Left $f\colon X\to\operatorname{Spec} R$ be a proper surjective map. If $R$ is regular noetherian, then $R\to\mathbf{R}\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ splits in $\mathbf{D}(A)$.
