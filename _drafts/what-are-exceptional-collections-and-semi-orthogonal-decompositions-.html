<p>I would like to make the analogy with <em>bases</em> and <em>subspaces</em> in <em>vectorspaces</em> (and explain how hard this analogy fails). The vectorspace in this case is a triangulated category, often from a geometric (i.e. $latex \mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(X)$ for some variety or scheme $latex X$) or algebraic (i.e. $latex \mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}(A)$ for some algebra $latex A$) origin. We want to study this triangulated category, and understand how much of the geometry or algebra is reflected in the properties of this category.</p>
<p>Let's write down the definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> TODO</p>
<p>The following table could summarise the situation in the geometric case, for which the whole setup works out more nicely than in the full generality of triangulated categories.</p>

<h2>Pathologies</h2>
<p>* triangulated dimension does not correspond to length of bases<br />
* geometric dimension does not correspond to length of bases<br />
* triangulated dimension does not equal geometric dimension (yet)<br />
* automorphisms are not known for Calabi-Yau varieties<br />
* lengths of maximal exceptional collections don't have to agree<br />
* exceptional collections don't satisfy the Jordan-HÃ¶lder property<br />
* Kuznetsov's base change "=" field extension, only works well for sufficiently nice extensions</p>
<p>SOD = categorical analogue of cell decomposition</p>
