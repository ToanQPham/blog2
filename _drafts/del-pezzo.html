<p>I'm currently writing up a paper where del Pezzo surfaces play a prominent role (at least, some noncommutative version of it). And my co-author likes to write <q>Del Pezzo surface</q>. It turns out that Miles Reid also has an opinion about it, for which I quote him from his paper <a href="#">Nonnormal del Pezzo surfaces</a>:

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>0.7 The great debate</strong> Rend. del circolo matematico di Palermo <strong>1</strong> (1887), p.&nbsp;382 records the admission to the circle of <em>dottore Pasquale del Pezzo, marchese di Campodisola</em>. It would be interesting to know why Corrado Segre writing in the same volume (p.&nbsp;218, 220, 221), along with every subsequent Italian writer, spells the Marquis' name incorrectly with a capital D.
</blockquote>

<p>So that settles the debate then.

<p>Another piece of colourful language from the same paper (it is Miles Reid after all) is the reference in paragraph&nbsp;2.10 to an SGA2 expos√© and Hartshorne's local cohomology lecture notes (both after notes by Grothendieck) as <em>Holy Scriptures</em>.

<p><small>Luckily said co-author told me he has no strong preference either way.</small>
