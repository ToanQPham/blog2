<p>In the line of "<em>things that I wished people had told me before</em>" I present to you today the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Benabou-Roubaud+theorem">Benabou--Roubaud theorem</a>. Once you know it's there it is easy to find it on the nLab, but if you don't know of its existence and try to read chapter 4.7 on the Barr--Beck--Lurie theorem in Lurie's <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/higheralgebra.pdf">Higher algebra</a> the relationship with descent in the usual sense might seem puzzling at first... I guess this is not the only instance (at least for me) of it being hard to understand the classical picture from the abstract viewpoint in Lurie :).</p>
<h2>Monads versus descent</h2>
<p>First: <em>what are <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monad">monads</a></em>? I am not going in details here, but a monad is an endofunctor together with two natural transformations that describe associativity and unit laws (hence a sort of multiplication on the monad). This makes the monad a monoid object in the category of endofunctors, explaining the terminology.</p>
<p>The main example of a monad is the monad induced by an adjunction $latex F\dashv G$: the endofunctor is $latex G\circ F$ and the natural transformations are induced by the unit and counit of the adjunction.</p>
<p>One more monad-thing that we need are modules over a monad.</p>
<p>Second: <em>what is descent</em>?</p>
<h2>On the Beck--Chevalley condition</h2>
<p>In the article by Benabou--Roubaud they put a condition on the bifibration, which is phrased in terms of <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Cartesian+morphism">(co)cartesian morphisms</a>. Again one can use the nLab to read about them. But in order to define the equivalence between descent morphisms and modules over a monad one needs to reformulate this condition in terms of a base change formula, which isn't hard but puzzled me at first. Hint: try to </p>
