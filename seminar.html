<p>I used to organise <a href="https://anagrams-seminar.github.io">ANAGRAMS</a>, a weekly student seminar at the University of Antwerp, centered around the topics of (noncommutative) algebra and algebraic geometry. Please take a look at the <a href="https://anagrams-seminar.github.io">seminar's webpage</a> for more information.

<p>I also used to co-organise the <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/rg/fundamental-mathematics/research/seminars/">weekly departmental seminar</a>, for which there is a <a href="http://sympa.ua.ac.be/sympa/info/antwerp-algebra-seminar">mailing list</a>.
