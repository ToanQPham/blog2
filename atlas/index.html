<h1>Atlas of $\Spec\mathbb{Z}[x]$</h1>
<p>This is a collection of "charts" for the affine scheme $\Spec\mathbb{Z}[x]$. I have collected these out of a certain fascination for this object, and its various visualizations. For an in-depth discussion of this object and an important visualization I refer you to <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/mumfords-treasure-map">Lieven Le Bruyn's blog post titled Mumford's treasure map</a>.

If you have a map to contribute, or any related information, please contact me!

The maps are ordered chronologically by publication date.

<h3 id="mumford-1966">1966, David Mumford, Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface</h3>
<p>Surprisingly (at least to me) there is a map that predates the <a href="#mumford-1967">canonical map of $\Spec\mathbb{Z}[x]$</a> in print by at least one year (maybe three, as David Mumford <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/vita06.pdf">himself gives 1964 as the publication date</a>). Lieven Le Bruyn has <a href="https://plus.google.com/115831511988650789490/posts/fAwrrkATpma">written about this at Google+</a>.

<p>It is published in his Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface, volume 59 of Annals of mathematics studies by Princeton Press. You can find it on page 28 of the book.

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atlas/mumford-curves.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/atlas/mumford-curves.png" alt="Mumford's first depiction of Spec Z[x]" /></a>

<p>Remark that is actually a depiction of $\Proj\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$.


<h3 id="mumford-1967">1967, David Mumford, Introduction to algebraic geometry: Preliminary version of first 3 Chapters</h3>
<p>This is probably the most well-known map because it has been covered in <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/mumfords-treasure-map">Mumford's treasure map</a>, and apparently <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2011/05/25/a-latex-version-of-mumfords-impression-of-spec-zx-or-some-tikz-tricks/">some guy even made a LaTeX version</a> of it. You can find it (if you have a precious copy of the original book) on page 141.

<h3 name="mumford-1988">1988, David Mumford, The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes</h3>
<p>I haven't been able to check this particular edition, which is the first reprint of David Mumford's classical book. It is named after the looks of the original 60s edition, which was a set of mimeographed notes bound together in a red cover. It is number 1358 in Springer's Lecture Notes in Mathematics, just like the 1999 reprint. The map is therefore listed under <a href="#mumford-1999">1999, David Mumford, The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes</a>. I presume they are completely similar.


<h3 name="reid-1995">1995, Miles Reid, Undergraduate Commutative Algebra</h3>
<p>Finally, a map that hasn't been drawn by David Mumford! In his undergraduate algebra handbook he gives the following impression on page 24

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atlas/reid-map.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/atlas/reid-map.png" alt="Reid's impression of Spec Z[x]" /></a>

<p>You should check the frontispiece of this book by the way, which gives a really interesting viewpoint on the phrase "Let $A$ be a ring and $M$ and $A$-module..."


<h3 id="mumford-1999">1999, David Mumford, The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes</h3>
In this reprint we find an updated version of the map of <a href="#mumford-1967">1967, David Mumford, The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes</a>. It is still number 1358 of Lectures Notes in Mathematics, and the map can be found on page 75.

<h3 id="eisenbud-2000">2000, David Eisenbud and Joe Harris, The Geometry of Schemes</h3>
<p>In their book The Geometry of Schemes, published by Springer in the series Graduate texts in mathematics as part 197 we find on page 85 their interpretation of a map of $\Spec\mathbb{Z}[x]$.

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atlas/eisenbud-geometry.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/atlas/eisenbud-geometry.png" alt="Eisenbud's and Harris' depiction of Spec Z[x]" /></a>

<p>On page 86 we find an impression of the subscheme $\Spec\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2-3)$, which makes this page even more atlas-like.

<h3 id="lebruyn-2009">2009, Lieven Le Bruyn, (non)commutative f-un geometry</h3>
<p>In his preprint <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2522">(non)commutative f-un geometry (arXiv:0909.2522)</a> Lieven Le Bruyn develops some of the ideas from the post <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/manins-geometric-axis">Manin's geometric axis</a> (which serves as a follow-up on Mumford's treasure map). It contains the first full-colour impression, see page 8! Interesting fact about David Mumford, according to Wikipedia he is colour blind.

<p>The <a href="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA2/ManinsCoordinates2.jpg">original version of this map</a> that focuses on the arithmetic nature of $\Spec\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a modified version of Mumford's 1967 map and is discussed by Lieven Le Bruyn <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/manins-geometric-axis">Manin's geometric axis</a>.


<h3 id="mumford-2015">2015, David Mumford and Tadao Oda, Algebraic Geometry II</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/alg_geom/papers/AGII.pdf">(penultimate) draft version</a> of their book contains an updated version of Mumford's original drawing on page 120.
